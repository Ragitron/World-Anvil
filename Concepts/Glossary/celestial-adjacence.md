# Celestial Adjacence

Celestial adjacency is a loose term referring to stars that are near enough to each that modern technology renders their distance meaningless.

An equivalent terrestial concept would be the shrinking of distance between distant towns and villages by way of the bicycle and telephone. (ie. the opposite of the idiom "the tyrrany of distance").

While celestial adjacency can be applied to any metric such as travel, commerce, and resource sharing, it is most frequently applied to stellar pairs, triplets, and in rare cases quadruplets where communication and information is up to the minute.
In a number of cases celestially adjacent stars even share a [Cognitive Network](../../Technology/network/network.md) uniting their citizens into a single population.

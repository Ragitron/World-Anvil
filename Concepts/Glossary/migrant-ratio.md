# Migrant Ratio

The migration ratio is a measure of the population growth in terms of internal migration, and immigration onto the planet.

$$m =\frac{i}{b}$$


(*m*)igrant ratio  
(*i*)mmigration = incoming population/year  
(*b*)irth rate/year

where *m* &gt; 1 the population of a planet is predominantly grown by immigration from other colonies.  
where *m* &lt; 1 the growth of a planet is primarily driven by internal birth rates.

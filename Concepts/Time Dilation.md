Time dilation is the observation that a clock on a moving platform observed from a stationary position will be seen to be ticking slower than a clock on the stationary position.

ie. Time slows down for you when you travel at the near light speeds compared to the plebs left on Earth

The Calculation is realitively simple:

T = T0/SQRT(1 - v^2/c^2)

where
T = passage of time for the stationary observer
T0 = passage of time for the moving observer
v = velocity of the moving observer
 c = 299 792 458 m/s

If we calculated v as a percentage of the speed of light we can derive a ration between the stationary and moving times.
ie.

for a v = 0.9c
T/T0 = 2.29416; or time passes half the speed when moving at 90% of the speed of light

To achieve life altering time dilation the speed needs to be increased even further, with the ration approaching infinity as v approaches c.

v = 0.99999c
T/T0 ~ 70

v = 0.9999999733
T/T0 = 4328

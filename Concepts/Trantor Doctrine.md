Trantor Doctrine refers to the strategic objectives of a military as being that of Orbital supremacy. Although never developed as a formal military theory, Marshall Trantor's for which the doctrine is named, would often invoke the importance of the orbital highground in his affairs as the First Marshall of the [[Colonial Protectorate]].  

The argument stood in opposition to conventional military thought at the time. Prior to the formation of the [[Colonial Protectorate]], stellar naval power was used to secure passage for planetary assault vessels. The focus of the few millitary operations then being to land a military force and impose marshal law.

## Pre-Colonial Protectorate

The [[Colonial Protectorate]] was formed to meet the threat of independent colonies to Earth's dominion. The hunger for raw resources to build the orbital infrastructure that would become [[Greater Terra]] could only be meet by fleets of freight ships drawing these resources from across the colonies. 

Whilst Earth maintained a light fleet of orbital skirmishers and artillery pieces these forces had become wasted after a century of neglect. While the burgeoning empire was by no means peaceful, the small scale conflict rarely required orbital combat. During this time [[Kessler Syndrome]] was still a grave threat to the success of any colony effort. 

The first extra-solar shipyard was built in the [[Teegarden]] system, and managed solely by the citizens of [[Teegarden#Madrid|Madrid]]. Whilst this shipyard was initially concieved to provide the planet with a planetary extraction fleet to access the rich resources of the systems planets, it was eventually retooled to produce orbital scale weapons. The driving factor was defense of resource claims against Corporate resourcing operations. The [[Teegarden#Madrid|Madrid]] Government had declared rights to the entire system, and aggressively pursued to maintain its claim, leading to the [[Teegarden#Teegarden Crisis|"Teegarden Crisis"]] and the destruction of a manned freighter contracted to [[Mombasa Exoplanetary]].

This altercation brought about the formation of the Terran 14th Fleet, under the command of Admiral Grayson - their First Officer being Captain Trantor. The resulting conflict resulted in the destruction of a number of automated mining buoys and the fatal wounding of the [[Teegarden]] flagship [[Noteworthy Vessels#Forbidden Intent|Forbidden Intent]] and the death of numerous - arguably visionary - military staff. The shipyard would remain intact and under the administrative authority of Earth. This small scale conflict would prove formative for Captain Trantor. It would be another century before the Captain would return to [[Teegarden]] as Marshall Trantor, now at the head of a the [[Colonial Protectorate#First Fleet|First Fleet]].

## [[Imperial Brush Fires|Brush Fire Wars]] 


The [[Teegarden#Teegarden Crisis|Teegarden Crisis]] would eventually trigger a cascade of resentment and revolution amongst the colonies. Previously being willing to compromise and negotiate resource rights with the Earth Government, the now real threat of military intervention further radicalised the already isolationist governments scattered throughout the periphery. The century following the crisis saw the largest military build up since the [[Greater Terra#Jovian Conflict|subjugation of the Jovian moons]]. 

Whilst not all colonies had the industry to produce shipyards, most could easily manufacture surface-to-orbit weapons, and in some cases traded for armanents and fleets amongst themselves. In an effort to prevent a descent into civil war, Earth granted numerous provisions to resource rights and self-governance to its core colonies - those that had essentially become self-sufficient. Smaller colonies without the benefit of stable local food and water production quickly acquiesced to demands.

A number of colonies descended into their own civil wars, as isolationist insurrections convulsed against the proto-governmental powers. In a few cases the Earth fleet would again be forced to intervene, landing their own security forces to quell any insurgency. As the colonies grappled with the new administrative landscape, each intervention triggered another armanent build-up. 

### Procyon Stalemate

The next major conflict saw the reformed Terran 14th Fleet, now under the command of Admiral Natasha Mubarak with her Flag Captain Trantor, sent to quell the system of [[Procyon]] where a large colonial population had concentrated on the planet [[Procyon#Paris]], drawn by the vast orbital infrastructure that had grown around the trade outpost. 

The reformed Terran 14th Fleet had now been bolstered with ships beyond the tonnage that had yet been seen by humanity. Sporting new reactors, new torch drives, and early variants of the inertial dampeners that eventually come to dominant ship design. The opposing Procyon fleet was by comparison a collection of retrofit freighters, shuttles, and corvettes previoulsy employed in customs work.  

Despite that discrepancy in fire power, the defensive fleet had the homefield advantage, using a number of clandestine launch bases scattered throughout the system to launch harrassing attacks against the Terran's flanks, leading the loss of most the artillery detachment and all but neutering the fleet for its intended assault on [[Procyon#Paris]]. Without the artillery detachment the 14th Fleet could only assault *ad hoc* orbital fotresses and shipyards to cripple the systems industrial capacity. Despite the conquest, the objective of capturing the planet was abandoned. 

In later memoirs Marshall Trantor would recount his objections, claiming that the 14th Fleet had in fact been victorious and need only remain in the system to force the [[Procyon]] government to accept Earth's treaty. Third party accounts of this are scant, although the experience of Procyon undoubtably influence the Marshall's strategic theory.

## Colonial Protectorate

Despite the victory, [[Procyon]] would be crippled by the 14th Fleet and would not recover it independent orbital infrastructure until the after the collapse of the [[First Empire]]. Returning to Earth the 14th Fleet was folded into the restructured Stellar Navy, eventually renamed the Colonial Protectorate. 

Defeated, Admiral Mubarak would step down from her position, allowing Captain Trantor to be promoted to Admiral and given the 1st Protectorate Fleet. Although at this time still under the direct governance of the Earth government, the Protecterate staff were given sweeping powers to act in the interests of the Earth Colonies. 

The new Admiral's first assignment, now 125 years after his first conflict, was to return to [[Teegarden#Madrid|Madrid]] where anti-Earth sentiment had continued to grow and the shipyard that had been preserved in orbit had now been retrofitted into a massive orbital infrastructure capable of manufacturing ships to compete with the new Earth-built Destroyers.

### Return to Madrid

The [[Procyon]] conflict now 30 years past, the battle to control [[Teegarden]] would begin with Admiral Trantors fleet arriving in the shadow of the dimunitive gas giant [[Teegarden#Hades|Hades]]. Surprsing the defending fleets, Trantor would push against every orbital position the Defenders had secured, overwhelming the wings of skirmish ships that had hoped to repeat the successes of [[Procyon]].

The 1st Protecterate Fleet would remain in the [[Teegarden]] periphery for a month before turning its advance on [[Teegarden#Madrid|Madrid]] itself. The defending fleet now crippled and scattered, the few Destroyer class ships remaining were outnumbered and quickly succumbed to barrage fire from missiles and cannon. 

The siege however, would never come, Trantor keeping his fleet in high orbit, beyond the range of surface-to-orbit weapons, became a fixture in the [[Teegarden#Madrid|Madrid]] skies for a further month. The surrender of the government eventualy forced as energy resources became scarce and expensive to manufacture on the ground. 

## Marshall Trantor

Returning to Earth after his victory, Admiral Trantor found himself now in the orbital dry docks of [[Greater Terra]]. The timid politics of the previous governments had been swept aside by imperial sentiment, spurred in large part by the Admiral's success. The Colonial Protectorate had now been released from civilian shackles, and would enact Terran policy autonomously across the small Empire. 

The success of [[Teegarden#Madrid|Madrid]] catapulted the Admiral to the highest offices of the Protectorate, and granted him the title of *Marshall*. Although he would never command a fleet again, his involvement woudl shape no only Protectorate Doctrine, but also policy. This would arguably lead to the atrocities of the [[First Empire#Civil War|Civil War]]. Although the term Trantor Doctrine was rarely referred to in his lifetime, the term becam popular following the Civil War, when the new generation of Admirals and Marshalls attributed the success of [[Greater Terra]] to said doctrine.

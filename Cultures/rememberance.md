# Rememberancers and Repository

Before the rise of the [Third Empire](.../Oraganisation/third-empire), the remnant kingdoms of [Kaifeng](../Systems/kaifeng.md) had spent centuries struggling in the shadow of the long nights. A gargantuan hulk of battle debris would block out their star for years at a time leaving their planet frigid and barren. Whole cities and nations would be wiped out, to famine, to war, and despair. With them was lost the knowledge of their populations. Technology forgotten in cycles, re-engineered, and forgotten again. 

## Remembrancer 

The first Rememberancer was a test subject of a prototype technology to map consciousness and thought. Memory was believed to be something more mystical and the transfer of memories, even vague shadows was a revelation. The long night was on the horizon and only a few people could realise the potential of the Remembrancers.

The Foundation, as they called it, worked to spread to bring together as much knowledge as it could. The first thousand were themselves scientists, alchemists, academics. A few could remember with clarity, many could only remember shapes and feeling, intuitively coming to understand the knowledge they were given. Some were driven to insanity, unable to parse the memories, their own become fragmented, their selves overwritten. To the Foundation as long the knowledge could be preserved it didn't matter. 

Only a few handfuls of the Rememberancers survived their first long night. Their memories shadowy, vague, difficult to interpret, more so to understand. It didn't matter to the small surviving fiefdoms. Knowledge of the world before the long night could endure. No longer having to be rediscovered. 

Each long night was another challenge, the Foundation reforged on their eves.

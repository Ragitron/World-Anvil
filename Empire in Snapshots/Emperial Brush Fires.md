The fall of *[[Kyoto]]* made further rebellion undesirable for most of the stronger colonies. Rising tax rates in the first era of the Empir however were generally resisted. Although most colonies understood that taxation fueled further colonisation and the exploitation of even more star systems.

A backlash agains the fragmentation of the Empire lead to the formation of the *[[Colonial Protecterate]]*. What would eventually develop in the [[Stellarii]] during the final ages of the [[First Empire]].

Following the rise of the [[First Empire]] most the colonies accepted rule without incident. Whilst some colonial governments resisted a heavy-handed approach most colonies accepted rule in exchange for strong logistic ties.

The fall of *[[Kyoto]]* made further rebellion undesirable for most of the stronger colonies. Rising tax rates in the first era of the Empir however were generally resisted. Although most colonies understood that taxation fueled further colonisation and the exploitation of even more star systems. 

Many reasoned that such endeavors could be left to private enterprise. The central Terran government tended toward autocracy and military pressure early. These actions incited numerous rebellian from colonial militias.

*[[Y3 Ceti]]* was lost to rebellion as the Terran Fleet attempted to secure vital ports. Although unsuccessful these rebellions made clear to [[Greater Terra]] that a lighter hand was needed. Throughout the following millenium numerous colonial freedoms were granted.

To counteract the decentralisation of the Empire, [[Greater Terra]] established the *[[Colonial Protecterate]]*. What would eventually develop in the [[Stellarii]] during the final ages of the [[First Empire]].

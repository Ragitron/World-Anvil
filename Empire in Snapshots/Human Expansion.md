Humanity has spread to colonise most of its local arm of the galaxy and continues to settle and conquer new planets on a generational timespan.
Although new settlements are founded with regularity, historians refer to human expansion in waves.
These waves are defined by a combination of time frame, groups of planets involved, political pressures for expansion, and the clustering of planets that are colonised.

[[First Expansion]]

The first expansion, occassionally referred to as the *Great Diaspora*, and as the maturation of mankind was actually the second attempt by humanity to colonise planets.
The first planet to be successfully settled was Io in the solar system, shortly after <Mars, Europa, the Moon, and Pluto were successfully settled with various purpose.
This clustering of human habitats is referred to as [[Greater Terra]] although in most common parlance any reference to *Earth* equally refers to these accessory colonies.

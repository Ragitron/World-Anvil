# Pre-Expansion Era

The *Pre-Expansion Era* generally refers  to the period of time before the establishment of the [[First Empire]]. Historians debate whether this period of time ended with the invention of the [[Epstein Drive]] or the establishing of the first stellar supply route - a period of two centuries.  

The *Pre-Expansion Era* is defined by the settling of the [[Sol System]] (what would develop into [[Greater Terra]]). Contrary to some views this Era did not preclude expansion to neighbouring star systems. Early Generation Ships would be launched to the nearest star systems although many of these failed, [[Tau Ceti]] and [[Barnard's Star]] would form small colonies early during this era. Of these only [[Tau Ceti]] would survive long enough to re-establish connection with the [[Sol System]].

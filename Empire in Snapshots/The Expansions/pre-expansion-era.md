# Pre-Expansion Era

The *Pre-Expansion Era* generally refers  to the period of time before the establishment of the [First Empire](../../Organisation/first-empire.md). Historians debate whether this period of time ended with the invention of the [Epstein Drive](../../Technology/Propulsion/epstein-drive.md) or the establishing of the first stellar supply route - a period of two centuries.  

The *Pre-Expansion Era* is defined by the settling of the [Sol System](../../Systems/greater-terra.md) (what would develop into [Greater Terra](../../Systems/greater-terra.md)). Contrary to some views this Era did not preclude expansion to neighbouring star systems. Early Generation Ships would be launched to the nearest star systems although many of these failed, [Tau Ceti](../../Systems/tau-ceti.md) and [Barnard's Star](../../Systems/barnards-star.md) would form small colonies early during this era. Of these only [Tau Ceti](../../Systems/tau-ceti.md) would survive long enough to re-establish connection with the [Sol System](../../Systems/greater-terra.md).

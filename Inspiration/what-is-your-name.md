# What is your name?

in the *Blue Cliff Records*, a 12th century collection of Chan (Chinese Zen) Buddhist koans, there is a passage  

> Kyozan Ejaku asked Sansho Enen, 'What is your name?'  
> Sansho said, 'Ejaku!'  
> 'Ejaku!' replied Kyozan, 'that's my name.'  
> 'Well then,' said Sansho, 'my name is Enen.'  
> Kyozan roared with laughter  


This passage is held in the book *"How the World Thinks"* by Julian Baggani as an example of the quasi-collectivism of eastern philosophy. Where the self is defined in terms of people around them.

It is interesting to imagine a culture in which the expectation is that when you introduce yourself to a stranger you should already know their name and they would know yours. Hierarchy would be visible in how higher status individuals would have an entourage who would make introductions.  

> 'Messr Samson, a pleasure to meet you,' I said approaching to offer my hand.  
> 'Mr Truman,' a thin aide exclaims to me, 'Messr Samson is ecstatic to make your acquaintance,'

# Colonial Protectorate

The  *Colonial  Protectorate* was  humanity's  first  attempt  to  create a galaxy spanning military.  Coalesced  from the  security  frigates of  the  [[Core  Worlds]]  the  Protecterate  was  initially conceived  as a  purely space-bound military.   

The first *Marshall* of the  *Colonial  Protectorate* was the General Trantor  who  had  lead the assault  on [[Madrid]] in orbit around [[Teegarden]]. *Marshal Trantor*  would  institute  what would later be referred to as the [[Trantor Doctrine]] which outlined the  role of orbital forces as ones of supremacy that would support local ground forces in the event of conflict.

The Jacobian Kingdom is considered by most historians to be the successor to the Second Empire.
While the Kingdom did not unite the human colonies throughout the Sapis Arm of the Milky Way, it was by far the the largest and most prosperous [[Stelgenta]].

## Early History

With the fall of the [[Second Empire]], and the loss of thousands of colonies across the galactic arm to the invasion of the Confederacy most surviving colonies consolidated their resources and nearby trade networks.
The planet of [[Tehran]] was uniquely situated at a nydus of trade routes, and itself controlled a valuable and well developed asteroid belt.
The presence of shipyard in orbit around its star also solidified its primacy as a military power in the sector.

Within less than a century [[Tehran]] was the administrative centre of 70 nearby planets and many voices in power were calling for expansive into the <link:internal>sapis arm</link:internal> as the Third Empire.
Although the trade empire was centred at [[Tehran]], many planets still maintained their own indepence, calls for unification as a [[Stelgenta]] were met with staunch opposition.

## Unification

Despite the picture of a prosperous planet, or as the beginnings of an empire, the internal politics of [[Tehran]] precluded serious action.
The local governments were divided on the matter of expansion.
Many resisted any call for aggressive expansion throughout the galaxy, for fear of drawing the attention of the Confederacy.

During this period a religious leader rose to prominence by preaching the the populations latent sense of nobility.
Appealing to [[Tehran]]'s history as a power that could negotiate on equal footing with the [[Second Empire]], Jacob was quickly elected into governance as a member of the small council.

Although not his real name, Jacob adopted the religious moniker to appeal to his followers.
It wasn't long before Jacob had amassed enough power with the people and the governments that he made moves to abolish the small council, instating himself as monarch of [[Tehran]].

At the same time, Jacob diseminated his gospel of the glory of humankind throughout the trade empire.
Numerous commentaries of the time period suggest that a general sense of despair had permeated humanity since the fall of the [[Second Empire]], driven largely by cognitive networks where old data grew stale and could never be eradicated.
Jacob's use of physical mediums is thought to have capitalised on the growing resentment of digital information.

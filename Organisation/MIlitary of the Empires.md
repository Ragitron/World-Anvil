# Military of the Empires

Traditionally the military organisation of the human empires have been divided into three branches.

- [[Stellarii]] - otherwise known as the imperial navy or simply the navy is responsible for most military engagements of the empire and is essential to force projection from Greater Terra

- [[Zephyrii or Atmospherii]] - the airbourne forces of the empires are tasked with planetary invasion and typically act as occupation forces. They also possess as small fleet of space-capable ships that are typically ferried by the Stellarii for local system occupation

- [[Petramean]] - these are local planetary forces that do not officially answer to the imperial defense directorate

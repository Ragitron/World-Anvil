# Colonial Protectorate

The  *Colonial  Protectorate* was  humanity's  first  attempt  to  create a galaxy spanning military.  Coalesced  from the  security  frigates of  the  [[core-worlds]]  the  Protecterate  was  initially conceived  as a  purely space-bound military.   

The first *Marshall* of the  *Colonial  Protectorate* was General Trantor  who  had  lead the assault  on [Madrid](teegarden.md#Madrid) in orbit around [Teegarden](teegarden.md). *Marshal Trantor*  would  institute  what would later be referred to as the [Trantor Doctrine](trantor-doctrine.md) which outlined the  role of orbital forces as ones of supremacy that would support local ground forces in the event of conflict.

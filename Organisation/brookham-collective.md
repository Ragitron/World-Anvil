# Brookham Collective

The Brookham Collective is a loose association of financiers that existed in last centuries of the [[second-empire]].
This group funded numerous trans-galactic projects in infrastructure and automated supply routes, but primarily focused on colonisation, and research into terraforming and geoengineering.

The Brookham Collective is of numerous organisations credited with preserving human civilisation after the fall of the [[second-empire]].

Eventually the group became a closer association of colonies at the perimeter of [[Human Expansion]] and formed the centre of would become the [[bellspeare-dynasty]].

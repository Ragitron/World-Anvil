# Jacobian Kingdom

In the shadow of the [Rampant](../Species/rampant.md) Invasion that brought the [Second Empire](../Organisation/second-empire.md) to its knees, the world of [Tehran](../Systems/mizar.md#Tehran) in the [Mizar System](../Systems/mizar.md) was home to some two to three hundred thousand surviving humans. These survivors would capitalise on the [Seed Vault](seed-vaults.md) left on their planet to re-establish their colony and expand as far as [Groombridge 1830](../Systems/groombridge-1830.md). The expansion eventually snuffed by internal conflicts.

## Reclaiming Tehran 

The planet of Tehran had been marginally hospitable for human habitation. After the mixed successes of terraforming initiatives from the [First](first-empire.md) and [Second Empires](second-empire.md), the atmosphere of the planet was comfortably close to one atmosphere, and lacked any significant toxicity to Terran life. 

However the [Rampant](../Species/rampant.md) invasion lead to widespread ecologic collapse across much of the planet. Within the vast canyons of the arctic continent a band of survivors took control of the planet's [Seed Vault](../Technology/seed-vaults.md) to survive the invasion. Following the withdrawal of the main [Rampant](../Species/rampant.md) fleet the survivors began to expand out of the canyons to take control of their continent. 

Upon re-establishing contact with other survivors the canyon settlement became a production centre for the manufacture of war materiele to reclaim the planet. The campaigns to destroy nesting grounds and reclaim old cities proceeded at a crawl defining the existence of several generations.  

Although the last of the [Rampant](../Species/rampant.md) would not be exterminated until the Kingdom was already in decline, the population would come under control within just under two centuries. The remaining [Rampant](../Species/rampant.md) would be confined to nomadic colonies in marginal territory and the occassional nest within cave networks and lava tubes. The junta council that had taken power within the canyons would declare victory over the [Rampant](../Species/rampant.md) to mark Year 0 of the *post fall*. 

## [Tres Chali](mizar.md#Tres%20Chali)

The city that would grow to fill the canyons of the arctic continent was the *de facto* capital of [Tehran](../Systems/mizar.md#Tehran) throughout the reclamation and became the cultural centre of the ascendant Kingdom. Although a manufacturing hub during the war with the [Rampant](../Species/rampant.md) this function was exported to the ancient cities that had been recaptured in the decades following Year 0.  

The geography of the city was centred around the vast canyons that coalesced in a central valley with a lake. The fringe agricultural land struggled to support the growing population during the reclamation - early campaigns focusing on reclaiming agrizones and surviving hydroponic plants - would be converted to the palace gardens in Year 133.  

The three main canyons became home for much of the housing and industry of the city, with a number of smaller canyons becoming military and governmental facilities. 

## Ihbin Jacob

By Year 0 the junta that had ruled over [Tres Chali](../Systems/mizar.md#Tres%20Chali) had become a critical institution, apprehensive to other forms of government lead to a constitution that imposed an almost permanent state of martial law. Not until Year 57 when the generation born after victory became to outnumber the old guard in neighbourhood councils did a cultural shift become obvious. 

Many thinkers of the time argued that the junta was in no position to dictate policy in peacetime and a number of outlying colonies that had remained in poverty and were exploited for agricultural output served as a rallying example. The persistence of the [Rampant](../Species/rampant.md) was used as counter-example, the danger of nomadic hordes was spun to garner support for ongoing martial law. Protests were few and much of the activism was pushed through neighbourhood councils that dictated regional taxes and housing allocations. 

The loss of a regional port to a [Rampant nest](../Species/rampant.md#Nesting%20and%20Broods) resulted in a swell of support for martial law to continue until complete eradication ^[Although a few conspiracy theories circulated at the time, no evidence could be presented that the junta *allowed* the attack on the port to justify continued rule. The prevailing explanation is that the port in question had become rarely used except by merchant explorers, and that the local garrison was under-manned at the best of times, lacking fortifications or mechanised forces.]. It continued to be argued that only martial law could ensure continued security. 

In Year 83 this narrative was challenged in the coastal city of [Company Landing](../Systems/mizar.md#Company%20Landing) where a number of hordes threatened to overwhelm the city. The city had adopted the neighbourhood council structure of [Tres Chali](../Systems/mizar.md#Tres%20Chali), however the local garrison ceded all control to the civilian population in an effort to free itself and concentrate its efforts on the city defensive. 

*Ihbin Jacob* was a career politician who had maneuvered his way into a neighbourhood council. Capatilising on the abdication of the officer corps, Ihbin ensured his rise to council chairman. Enticing the other councils with the prospect of collective dealings with [Tres Chali](../Systems/mizar.md#Tres%20Chali), Ihbin then masterminded the writing of a local constitution that not only dictated taxation and housing policy, but also leveraged its position to become the benificiary of warehouse rents in port. These revenue was used for further development of the city's infrastructure making the council popular, and exceedingly wealthy. 

Ihbin then turned his attention to the defense of the city. Coaxing a meeting with garrison commanders Ihbin identified the shortfalls in the military logistics and engineering. Drawing numerous concessions from the garrisons to ensure the enduring civilian control of the city councils, Ihbin contracted several civilian manufacturing plants in [Tres Chali](../Systems/mizar.md#Tres%20Chali) and [Company Landing](../Systems/mizar.md#Company%20Landing) to produce fortifications, equipment, and ammunition, as well providing meals and staffing for multiple facilities.

The success of the defensive actions at [Company Landing](../Systems/mizar.md#Company%20Landing) was widely attributed to the actions of the city council, with Ihbin Jacob becoming widely popular across the planet. The critical mass of public support ensured the success of Ihbin's first presidential campaign in Year 95. The presidency marked the end fo a decade of violent repression by the junta which had lashed out against the neighbourhood councils and protests. Ihbin Jacob served his final term in Year 113 and handed over power to quasi-democrat rule ^[Widespread voting was never a part of [Tehran's](../Systems/mizar.md#Tehran) political system. Neighbourhood council instead voted for the presidency and the cabinet, with military appointing its own cabinet members. Within the neighbourhood councils, local populations were free to attend meetings (and some regions implemented *ad-hoc* voting for specific issues) and voice their concerns and wishes. The voice of the people would be protected by a federal council charter, although regional variations existed for specific roles and powers].  

Growing rich from the open economic markets Ihbin Jacob established his dynasty in [Tres Chali](../Systems/mizar.md#Tres%20Chali). His daughter *Wilhelmina Jacob* inherited the majority of his investment holding, while his son *Ju-Tao Jacob* inherited the political reputation. Although not as successful in massing popular support Ju-Tao did leverage his piddling political power to grow his own wealth and dynasty.  

### Kingdom  

Although much ink would be spilt arguing when the *Years of Upheavel* trully began, it is generally accepted that the inauguration of *Gregori Hao Tseng* to the presidency was a critical  turning point for [Tehran's](../Systems/mizar.md#Tehran) turn toward absolute monarchy. The uneasy stability of the post-junta democracy was held up by a delicate push and pull of reforms and tradition. Although the military would never again control the neighbourhood councils, they would remain the primary arbiters in the judicial system, barring any judge that had never served from a politically crucial appointment. Popular support for military spending was marked by seasons, with the reality of the [Rmpant](../Species/rampant.md) threat never being clear to the general population ^[Although very real, the threat would never trully menace major cities such as [Tres Chali](../Systems/mizar.md#Tres%20Chali), where the fear consistently ranked among the top five concerns of the population in polls. In more remote regions the population was given more freedom in personal armament - the legality of which was rarely defined, and never tested - the threat of infestation was tempered by a sense of personal control].   

A series of crop failures and a [Rampant infestation](../Species/rampant.md) of a large port that provided control of the western oceans lead many to again question the ability of a civilian leadership to protect the colony. The Year 137 famine resulted in a collapse of multiple industries and peripheral settlements, and a refugee crisis at [Tres Chali](../Systems/mizar.md#Tres%20Chali). By Year 139 the cities granaries were losing more food than could be imported. Rationing was imposed by the central council. The military was given the power to enforce the ration, and Martial Law returned to the capital.

Arguing that rationing had done nothing to avert the famine as over ten thousand people had died of starvation by Year 140, *Gregori Hao Tseng* began his presidential campaign against *Murak Ihbin Jacob*. The son of *Wilhelmina Jacob*, Murak was a decorated veteran that had not only fought in the defense of [Company Landing](../Systems/mizar.md#Company%20Landing) during his grandfather's ascendancy, but had commanded the scouring of the *Massive Steppe* where much of the [Rampant hordes](../Species/rampant.md) had been allowed to roam freely. 

Murak had never seen eye-to-eye with his grandfather, but with his death in Year 125 and Wilhelmina's aversion to politics, Murak began his political career by warping his grandfather's words to pull support from the pro-military population and the military itself. By Year 130 Ihbin Jacob's views on direct military rule had been absorbed into Murak's own retoric of leadership from the top, describing a central authority to which the civilian government and the military command answered. This was ambigious enough that even anti-military factions viewed Murak favourably, believing his presidancy would be the final nail in the military's political aspirations. 

During the final months to the decision by the neighbourhood councils Hao Tseng unveiled his true intentions of ending Martial law and finally reigning in the military. Murak attacking his opponent for not knowing enough to command, that the military would not relinquish their control without a strong leader as chairman. The election result was finally announced in the middle of the year, during the wet season when the palace lake swelled to consume the artificial flood plain inside. Rivers flowed through the city washing away those that were too weak from starvation, or had simply collapsed and died. 

The inauguration of *Gregori Hao Tseng* lasted two hours before the crowd turned on itself. Despite the heated division amongst the crowd, the military police responsible for security made no effort to separate the political factions. Before Gregori could finish his speech gunshots were ringing out in front of the palace. The military moved quickly to impose their own control over the city, expanding martial law to its pre-Year 0 state. In order to avoid the unrest of the 60 and 70s, the Military installed Murak to the presidency. Before the year was out Murak had secured absolute power within [Tres Chali](../Systems/mizar#Tres%20Chali). 

Murak had maneuvered around Gregori with the skill of his grandfather, buying endorsements and favours from the civilian and military cabinets. Leveraging the trust the military had in him Murak codified oversight of military authority by himself alone, arguing that he could command the trust of the people; thereby avoiding his rivals in the military. Similarly from the civilian cabinet his approval was required for any vote to be passed from the neighbourhood councils. 

Before the commanders in the military understood what was happening Murak was prosecuting a winnowing of his rivals within the military. The council that Murak established was filled with pliable politicians with ties in the expansive logistic network that had once kept [Tres Chali](../Systems/mizar.md#Tres%20Chali) fed; and generals that risen through the ranks along with Murak in a fraternity of command. Weakened by famine the city could not resist and only handfuls of protesters could summon the strength to march through the muddy streets and picket the palace.  

Civil war came to [Teharn](../Systems/mizar.md#Tehran) in all but name. Needing to secure a stable food supply Murak send his war council to extract all the resources that outlying settlements could provide. The violence visited on these colonies was rarely known of within the canyons of the capital. Only the spoils of full granaries and store shelves reached the population. The famine was never averted but the Capital would not starve. Apathy toward the totalitarian government, and fear of going hungry for another year would suppress any resistance.  

Military and militia factions could only provide token resistance. As long as the 2 million people that filled the Capital's canyons remained fed, they rarely protested how they were sustained. [Company Landing](../Systems/mizar.md#Company%20Landing) would become a police state, its population drafted to labour. Smaller cities and towns would experience similar oppression, while those that resisted would become ashen fertilizer.  

Year 145 passed with whispers of a new election, the end of Murak's term as president. Year 149, the calls would grow louder. Emboldened the people began to protest again. The agitation would be quelled by massive forced exports of labour to the depolutated agrizones of the surrounding continent. Under the eye of the prime council's aristocrats the industry of the planet would be manned by dissenters and protestors.

<!---
The Jacobian Kingdom is considered by most historians to be the successor to the Second Empire.
While the Kingdom did not unite the human colonies throughout the Sapis Arm of the Milky Way, it was by far the the largest and most prosperous [[stelgenta]].

## Early History

With the fall of the [[second-empire]], and the loss of thousands of colonies across the galactic arm to the invasion of the Confederacy most surviving colonies consolidated their resources and nearby trade networks.
The planet of [[mizar]] was uniquely situated at a nydus of trade routes, and itself controlled a valuable and well developed asteroid belt.
The presence of shipyard in orbit around its star also solidified its primacy as a military power in the sector.

Within less than a century [[mizar]] was the administrative centre of 70 nearby planets and many voices in power were calling for expansive into the <link:internal>sapis arm</link:internal> as the Third Empire.
Although the trade empire was centred at [[mizar]], many planets still maintained their own indepence, calls for unification as a [[stelgenta]] were met with staunch opposition.

## Unification

Despite the picture of a prosperous planet, or as the beginnings of an empire, the internal politics of [[mizar]] precluded serious action.
The local governments were divided on the matter of expansion.
Many resisted any call for aggressive expansion throughout the galaxy, for fear of drawing the attention of the Confederacy.

During this period a religious leader rose to prominence by preaching the the populations latent sense of nobility.
Appealing to [[mizar]]'s history as a power that could negotiate on equal footing with the [[second-empire]], Jacob was quickly elected into governance as a member of the small council.

Although not his real name, Jacob adopted the religious moniker to appeal to his followers.
It wasn't long before Jacob had amassed enough power with the people and the governments that he made moves to abolish the small council, instating himself as monarch of [[mizar]].

At the same time, Jacob diseminated his gospel of the glory of humankind throughout the trade empire.
Numerous commentaries of the time period suggest that a general sense of despair had permeated humanity since the fall of the [[second-empire]], driven largely by cognitive networks where old data grew stale and could never be eradicated.
Jacob's use of physical mediums is thought to have capitalised on the growing resentment of digital information.

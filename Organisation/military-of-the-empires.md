# Military of the Empires

Traditionally the military organisation of the human empires have been divided into three branches.

- [Stellarii](../Organisation/Stellarii/stellarii.md) - otherwise known as the imperial navy or simply the navy is responsible for most military engagements of the empire and is essential to force projection from Greater Terra

- [Zephyrii or Atmospherii](../Organisation/Stellarii/zephyrii.md) - the airbourne forces of the empires are tasked with planetary invasion and typically act as occupation forces. They also possess as small fleet of space-capable ships that are typically ferried by the Stellarii for local system occupation

- [Petramean](../Organisation/Stellarii/petramean.md) - these are local planetary forces that do not officially answer to the imperial defense directorate

- [Praetorian](../Organisation/Stellarii/praetorian.md) - although not traditionally recognised as a branch in its own right, the Officer class of the Terran Militaries has often transcended branches. [Academy](../Places%20of%20Interest/university-of-luyten.md) recruits are typically drawn from [Petramean](../Organisation/Stellarii/petramean.md) Officers, to be trained for service as Generals of the [Zephyrii](../Organisation/Stellarii/zephyrii.md) or Marshalls amongst the [Petramean](../Organisation/Stellarii/petramean.md). The Admiralty is typically drawn from these Generals, although exceptions are not unheard of.

# Military of the Empires

Traditionally the military organisation of the human empires have been divided into three branches.

- [[Stellarii]] - otherwise known as the imperial navy or simply the navy is responsible for most military engagements of the empire and is essential to force projection from Greater Terra

- [[Zephyrii|Zephyrii or Atmospherii]] - the airbourne forces of the empires are tasked with planetary invasion and typically act as occupation forces. They also possess as small fleet of space-capable ships that are typically ferried by the Stellarii for local system occupation

- [[Petramean]] - these are local planetary forces that do not officially answer to the imperial defense directorate

- [[Praetorian]] - although not traditionally recognised as a branch in its own right, the Officer class of the Terran Militaries has often transcended branches. [[university-of-luyten|Academy]] recruits are typically drawn from [[Petramean]] Officers, to be trained for service as Generals of the [[Zephyrii]] or Marshalls amongst the [[Petramean]]. The Admiralty is typically drawn from these Generals, although exceptions are not unheard of.

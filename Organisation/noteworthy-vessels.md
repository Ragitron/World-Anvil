# Forbidden Intent

The *Forbidden Intent* was one of the Capital-Class weight ships manufactured by and extrasolar shipyard at the beginning of the [First Empire](../Organisation/first-empire.md). Officially constructed by [Garden Industries](../Organisation/Corporations/garden-industries.md) - a mining comglomorate of the [Teegarden](../Systems/teegarden.md) System - the *Forbidden Intent* was actually a refit freight cruiser from Earth. 

Originally constructed by the solar shipyards of the [Brandenburg Collective](../Organisation/Corporations/tuajen.md#Brandenburg%20Collective) the *Glass Have Full* - as it was first christened - was one of a limited run of manufactured starships that would be referred to as *Freight Cruisers*. Such cruisers generally outweighed any freighter of the time and utilised a fragmenting cargo hold design. These fragmenting holds hosted their own drone supply ships that could peel away from the cruiser and accelerate to target beyond accelerations that could not be survived by human crew. The intention of such carriers were to speed up the arduous process of loading and unloading by initiating it from the moment a *Freight Cruiser* was at its destination system.   

Ultimately the *Freight Cruiser* design proved financially unsustainable as critical maintenance could not be conducted outside shipyards and *Cruisers* were rarely compatable with traditional shipping crates loaded by a dock crane or tug. The ships did eventually find use in prosperous mining systems where autonomous freight drones proved valuable in the movement of raw material allowing carrier ships to remain in deep mining orbits.

The *Glass Have Full* would eventually be sold to private enterpreneurs and then to the Teegarden Colonial Administration that would decommission the ship and reappropriate its drone supply ships for a near planetary orbit logistic network. The main body of the ship being given over to a research institute for orbital surveillance of Teegarden's moon [Trafalgar](../Systems/teegarden.md#Trafalgar).

The recommissioning of the *Glass Have Full* - now known as *Jovial Moon* - was instated by a reformed [Madrid](../Systems/teegarden.md#Madrid) government that had risen to power amidst a wave of anti-colonial sentiment. By this time, the drone supply network had developed into an extensive orbital infrastructure including the first extrasolar shipyard. Lacking the engineering and design expertise of Earth, the citizen collective [Garden Industries](../Organisation/Corporations/garden-industries.md) instead used the *Jovial Moon* as a basic structure for its own ship design. The drone supply ships would be reverse engineered into autonomous weapons platforms and the *Jovial Moon* itself would be reinforced to brandish two kinetic missile launchers on its lateral axes. 

The *Forbidden Intent* would be unveiled by the [Madrid](../Systems/teegarden.md#Madrid) Government as the systems defensive flagship and would ignite the [Brush Fire Wars](../Empire%20in%20Snapshots/imperial-brush-fires.md) of the [First Empire](../Organisation/first-empire.md). Although its ultimate fate would be as planetary debris following its fatal wounding in the [First Madrid Liberation War](../Systems/teegarden.md#teegarden-crisis), the *Forbidden Intent* continued a rich life in fiction and political rhetoric as a symbol of rebellion and independence.

## Technical Aspects

The original *Glass Have Full* carried a complement of seventy-one supply drones in a heptagonal radial array with a singular drone in a caudal docking ring. The system critical "head" of the ship carried the crew compartment and powerplant, pulling the freight array by three hybrid torch drives.

During its retrofit, the *Forbidden Intent* would be reinforced along three axes of its heptagonal array. The drone housings would also be enlarged, reducing the number of drones in each column. The final complement would be twenty-eight drones. The caudal drone bay being refit into a pinnace dock that served to provide the Capital ship with capacity to board other vessels.  

The two kinetic missile launchers were refurbished surface-to-orbit weapons firing the locally designed KX-881 missile. Such missiles had a theoretical range of 0,65 AU in combat engagements, however during a siege, the *Forbidden Intent*'s targeting systems could - again in theory - calculate precision kills beyond several AU if not from a Star System's terminus. Along its ventral axis a battery of four Grazers provides close combat capability against most vessels.

The primary armanent of the *Forbidden Intent* was intended to be a large missile network facilitated by its twenty-eight drones carrying large complements of KX-700 kinetic kill missiles. The autonomous drones were designed to loiter in stealth orbits providing what was referred to as "orbital caltrops" that opposition forces would need to fight through or circumnavigate to attack at the *Forbidden Intent* directly.

## Death of the Forbidden Intent 

The [Teergarden Crisis](../Systems/teegarden.md#teegarden-crisis) began with the entry of the *Wayward Hamiltonian* into the System. Contracted by [Mombasa Exoplanetary](../Organisation/Corporations/mombasa-exoplanetary.md) almost a century of time debt prior, the *Wayward Hamiltonian* was bound for a previously surveyed asteroid rich in heavy metals and related isotopes. Two decades prior the [Madrid Government](../Systems/teegarden.md#madrid) had passed the *Stellar Soveriegnty Act*, declaring itself the sole proprietor of all celestial bodies within its system, in breach of the *Colonial Rights Act* by which corporate entities from Earth still operated.  

Three months of travel separated the aging freighter from its quarry and the Teedgarden Fleet acted immediately to interdict the freighter. Responding to hails with a standard contract code and transmitting its right to enact its contract, the *Wayward Hamiltonian* proceeded through the customs ships. A month into its journey the interdiction fleet was given permission to violently inact its mission, while the *Forbidden Intent* watched from the sidelines.   

The interdiction fleet however, unwilling to fire upon a civilian ship, made threats with weapon locks and launching loiter munitions to coast with the *Wayward Hamiltonian*. Without logs from the destroyed freighter, it can only be assumed that the crew interpreted these actions as empty threats. During its seventh week however, the *Wayward Hamiltonian* penetrated the *Forbidden Intent*'s orbital cordon, triggering an autonomous strike from two drones. A salvo of twelve missiles from the two drones would reduce the *Wayward Hamiltonian* to nothing but a cloud of dust and fuel.

The Terran 14th fleet would arrive twenty-four years after the death of the *Wayward Hamiltonian* with a mandate to depose the [Madrid Government](../Systems/teegarden.md#madrid) and impose martial law upon the colony.

# Void Native

The Void Native was commissioned in the year 3021 of The [Second Empire](../Organisation/second-empire.md) and was part of the seventh revision of the robust *Tuajen pcs300* series of cargo ships. Notably, the Void Native was eventually bought by Quinn Olstadt in the year 3029 and saw service as a freelance hauler until it and her crew disappeared in the year 3041 - the calculated age of the ship remained 3.62 years.

## Commission

The Void Native was first commissioned by the Xenial Corporation as part of an order of 3 000 cargo ships to bolster its galactic shipping arm.
The Void Native, along with two hundred and ninety-nine companion ships were manufactured at the [Johannesburg](../Systems/kruger-60.md#Johannesburg) orbital shipyards under contract to the [Johannesburg](../Systems/kruger-60.md#Johannesburg) Federal Manufacturing Corporation.

Of the ten shipyards used for the production of the pcs300 series, [Johannesburg](../Systems/kruger-60.md#Johannesburg) was widely regarded as the most prestigious location.
The ships manufactured there had higher purity materials, had significantly reduced failure rates for components, and no ship has suffered a spontaneous catastrophic failure.
Indeed following the bankruptcy of the *Xenial Corporation*, the cargo fleet was sold off, with ships manufactured at [Johannesburg](../Systems/kruger-60.md#Johannesburg) being in high demand.

## Corporate Use

The blackbox of the Void Native records a total of 73 delivery flights across the [Second Empire](../Organisation/second-empire.md).
This totalled a relativistic travel time of 2 years, and a service history of 13 years when it was sold.

Datalogging and ship-board diagnostics recorded five separated malfunctions, predominantly of the retrofitted entertainment system, and one failure of the ship's communication array.

## Freelancing

Quinn Olstadt purchased the *Void Native* from the Bank of Yakutsk following the bankruptcy of the Xenial corporation.

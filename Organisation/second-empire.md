# The Second Empire  - The Grand Empire of Humanity 

## Treaty Planets

## Second Restoration

***

## Collapse

During the last great expansion [Greater Terra](../Systems/greater-terra.md) found itself at the heart of a leviathian of industrialised systems, corporate fiefdoms, and minor colonies. Limited by the fledging technology of the [Ansible](../Technology/network/superluminal-communication.md) the government ceded much of its power to any local authority they could find. 

Contrary to the prevailing beliefs of subsequent empires, the [Rampant](../Species/rampant.md) did not precipitate the collpase of the Second Empire, although arguments could be made about whether the Second Empire even at its height could not defend against the [Rampant](../Species/rampant.md). However even fractured, humanity managed to stave off catastrophe for centuries before the [Rampant](../Species/rampant.md) reached the oort cloud of [Greater Terra](../Systems/greater-terra.md).

At its height the [Second Empire](#The%20Second%20Empire%20-%20The%20Grand%20Empire%20of%20Humanity) was already fighting policing conflicts amongst the ancient infustrial colonies that struggled to integrate. [Tobruk](tobruk.md#The%20Fall%20of%20Tobruk) being considered the last of the conflicts marked the significant turning point for the [Terran Home Fleet](../Organisation/Stellarii/terran-home-fleet.md) in particular. Scarred by peripheral conflicts [Greater Terra](../Systems/greater-terra.md) confined its fleet to a 20 ly sphere of influence.

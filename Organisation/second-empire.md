# The Second Empire  - The Grand Empire of Humanity 



***

## Collapse

During the last great expansion [Greater Terra](greater-terra.md) found itself at the heart of a leviathian of industrialised systems, corporate fiefdoms, and minor colonies. Limited by the fledging technology of the [[Ansible|Ansibles]] the government ceded much of its power to any local authority they could find. 

Contrary to the prevailing beliefs of subsequent empires, the [[rampant]] did not precipitate the collpase of the Second Empire, although arguments could be made about whether the Second Empire even at its height could not defend against the [[rampant]]. However even fractured, humanity managed to stave off catastrophe for centuries before the [[rampant]] reached the oort cloud of [Greater Terra](greater-terra.md).

At its height the [[second-empire]] was already fighting policing conflicts amongst the ancient infustrial colonies that struggled to integrate. [[tobruk#The Fall of Tobruk obsidian World-Anvil chroniclesOne 01-Chapter-One|Tobruk]] being considered the last of the conflicts marked the significant turning point for the [[Terran Home Fleet]] in particular. Scarred by peripheral conflicts [[greater-terra]] confined its fleet to a 20 ly sphere of influence.

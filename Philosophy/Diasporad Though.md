> "What the mind of the human animal most desire is to discover for itself the essence of the universe; and in so doing understand its own future"

- Tristan the Wanderer,  The Focusing Lens

Diasporad thought refers to the rise of philosophical - and eventually politic - thought that extolled the virtues of exploring the physical universe as a means of exploring the metaphysical self. The ideas of Diasporad thought were first expressed in cy-net of the early First Empire and lack any direct credit.

Over time Diasporad Thought developed against the rise of the centralised power of the First Empire. Philosophers and theorists posited that the foundation of the empire was the free enterprise to explore and populate the galaxy. The growing authoratarian approach to celestial governance adopted by the First Empire's senators quickly removed many of the freedoms the colonies had enjoyed for centuries.

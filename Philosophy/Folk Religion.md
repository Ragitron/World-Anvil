Although monotheism remained popular in one form or another, late Firsh Empire religious leaders shifted focus toward prophets as sources of guidance. By abandoning the ideas of divine creation inherent to supranatural deities folk religions no longer clashed with the sciences that brought so much prosperity.

Initially focusing on mainstream prophets and saints these religions eventually adopted personalities from history that epitomised ideals. Worship focused on emulating the characteristics of particular saints.

Whilst this approach lacked the ideas of afterlife and holy rebirth, populations embraced the ideas turning local heros into idols. With no afterlife worshippers sought accolades amongst their peers and the promise becoming worshipped themselves.

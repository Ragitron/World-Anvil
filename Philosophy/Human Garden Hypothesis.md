The *Human Garden* is the notion that the endless generations of humanity turn ceaselessly until individuals are born that will inevitably impel a society to to change. In opposition to the [[Confluence Hypothesis]], the Garden hypothesis observes that societies over a long enough timeline will continue to perpetuate old traditions, only chnaging when challenged by a great individual.

In the Garden, society is a passive process with its inhabitants only purpose being the continuation of the society in which they reside. Eventually a great individual will advance that society toward great complexity of thought and culture. Although such progress is often mired by periods of stagnation, calamity, or conflict with other societies.

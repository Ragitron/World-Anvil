# The Believers

... a derivative of an ancient pre-[[Second Expansion]] religion that espouses the limitations of man and their ability to think for themselves. They believe that the foundation of their beliefs is beyond their control and that they will be punished if they do not convert others. Apostasy is thus considered a failing of the priest of their church.

The younger sect of this religion believes that even belief under force is preferable to unbelief and will attack and torture unbelievers.

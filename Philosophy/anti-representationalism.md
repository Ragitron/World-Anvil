[Inspired by this article about the falsity of the Computational Metaphor of the human](https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer?mc_cid=9e80c8cf81&mc_eid=603c2330b2)

The myth of the human mind as a computer has long been enterntained beyond the point of utility across the terran empires. The network is exactly the representation of human misunderstanding of their own brains. 

Crude implants jab at the human limbic system to evoke a response and the generalised activity of a human is broadcast like a simulacrum of communication. If any true work is to be done with a human mind in the network the human must train in the network for a lifetime. They must have bespoke [[fractal-manufacturing|neural chipset]] for any interface they use. In some circles neuromechanists discuss the limitations of such transient connections and discuss heretical notions of [[anchor|integrating a human in whole]] into the machineries of the network.

In truth after the rise of two human empires, and the collapse of one, we have yet to grasp what happens inside our own heads. We still cling to the idea that we can creat a silicon cage for our minds and refuse to acknowledge the what such a machine would lose. Not just humanity but the mind itself.

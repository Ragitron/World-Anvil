# Emergent Immortality

> A mind is a terrible thing to lose. In the age of stone and dirt humanity carried its mind within itself for fleeting infinitesmal fractions of time. In the following millenia of paper and stone humans could impart fractions of their mind into the page. The mind is no longer tied to neurons, it can be replicated infinitely in text.

The notion of emergent consciousness from the information content of the brain carries the implication that if this information is replicated elsewhere the quanta of consciousness is replicated with it. 

In much the same way that genes can produce an extended phenotype, shaping the world around them. Agents can produce an extended consciousness, imprinting themself on the world around them. In a similar way that an animal does not reproduce itself by its extended phenotype, a consciousness does not replicate itself by the information it imprints. 

Rather the imprint of that conscious mind is both unique and universal, parts shared and shaped by the surrounding mileu of minds, parts wholly the individual's own. 

What of minds that cannot express themselves in the world? Dolphins may not have language or the written word, we cannot translate for them and reproduce their racist rants against porpoises. But they do have communities wihtin which they communicate, impose their personalities, perhaps not abstract ideas but certainly the others in their pod are changed by the interaction.

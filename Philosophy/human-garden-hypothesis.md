# Human Garden Hypothesis

> "These automatons merely run the machinery of empire, their consciousness would be questionable if not for their endless complaints. How such masses of human misery breed greatness is beyond me"

The *Human Garden* is the notion that the endless generations of humanity turn ceaselessly until individuals are born that will inevitably impel a society to to change. In opposition to the [[confluence-hypothesis]], the Garden hypothesis observes that societies over a long enough timeline will continue to perpetuate old traditions, only chnaging when challenged by a great individual.

In the Garden, society is a passive process with its inhabitants only purpose being the continuation of the society in which they reside. Eventually a great individual will advance that society toward great complexity of thought and culture.; or more accurately to change. Although such progress is often mired by periods of stagnation, calamity, or conflict with other societies. 

Within this theory are two competing interpretations. The widely held is the *Catalyst* or *Wallerian* interpretation that presents great individuals as catalysts as in chemistry. These individuals accentuate existing processes in society, the exaggeration forcing change due to disruption.  

The competing *Heretic* or *Hegelian* interpretation presents great individuals in conflict with the existing world. The interpretation posits that greatness inherently leads to conflict with wider society, and the greater the individual the more they pull society to their view. This suggests that the greatest individuals have existed in the widest societies that have required the most significant change. However in the modern era this has lead to slower change as "greater" individuals - and hence rarer - are required to pull these wider more modern societies to change.

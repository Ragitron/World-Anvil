# Malignant Individualism

> The sheer absence of community to the point of exploitation at all cost.

This concept is based on the [Solarians](https://asimov.fandom.com/wiki/Solaria), of the foundation series that hate physical contact living on empty estates and having no quams of murdering trespassers.

# Types of Societies

<!-- 
With absolutely no reference to any other text yet. This page lays out some central tenets that each empire is meant to explore.

<!-- Since the formation of tribes and clans ^[Clans in the sense of a grouping of family groups united by some familial lines that may share elders and such. I have no idea if this is a valid use of the word but I will subjugate its use here; a quick search shows most people seem to say cans are small family units, until your reach the wiki page which doesn't involve a direct comparison but describes something that is clearly more nebulous and large than a tribe] humanity has sought to unite themselves against common threats; whether these threats are the hunger, predators, the environment, and most commonly, other humans. The way humanity has united themselves has evolved beyond simple family groups and local geography. Encompassing  -->

<!-- human societies have sought to unify themselves around a common set of principles --> 
Humanity has sought to unite itself against the destructive forces of entropy since it has walked upright. This unity has taken many forms in the distant past. At times being achieved with naked force, and at others with subtle phrase. Always the goal has been to turn the wills of individuals towards a common cause. Whether that be the preservation of family, culture, or borders; the group has defined itself by its common values. Within these structures the games of politics have always played and it has been the players that choose to leave those structures that bring down empires. The historical development of these unifying structures has culminated in the empires of galactic humanity. 

<!-- the earliest of these principles was that of family and kinship --> 
On the plains of the savanna the earliest of human clans were bound together by patriarchs and matriarchs, relying familial ties to build tribes. The great march of entropy has stripped away any historical fact we might scrutinise of the earliest of man's societies. Family groups bound together by a common elder continue to exist on the most far flung colony, and the the most isolated of habitats. In truth it seems that regression of the human mind pushes it toward family and kin, and not in fact toward barbarism as so much literature seems to imply. 

<!-- as human groups grew larger, encompassing more than family and kinship these principles were forced to adapt -->
Kin alone was not enough to unite larger communities and the wisened leaders of these ancient cultures found other means. Early tribes were brought together under elders and chiefs to cooperate in gathering resources and defending themselves. It is this behaviour that would evolve into the earliest towns. As some societies settled the fertile valleys of the middle east of the old earth they would begin to cooperate on the shared experience fo their geography and their labour.

<!-- this adaptation was the impetus for the development of culture, and culture became the unifying principle for millenia -->  
Growing communities were thus forced to cooperate with more disparate peoples, leveraging language and eventually culture to bring their societies together. Culture became a force in its own right, turning barbarians into greeks and compeling societies into forming grand empires. The halmark of the earliest cultures was the turning of conquered peoples into citizens the *hellenisation* of the peoples of the black sea and mediteranean, and other *-isations* and *-ifications* became a tool of conquest. Those that were denied the opportunity of becoming cultured instead became enslaved - the irony of course that a slave must become part of the culture to be of any value. In the end, even those that conquered the greeks would come to be dominated by that culture.

<!-- the fact that civilizations that valued family over culture were thought a regression is testament to culture as the superceding principle -->
The great tragedy of the ancient world had for millenia been the collapse of the cultured states, and a return to the dark age of familial ties and bloodlines. The ancient kings that carved up the classical world abandoned the concept of culture for their own dynasties. The fragmentation of the world demonstrating the feeble nature of kinship to hold together vast groups of people. Kingdoms dominated old earth until the rediscover of the culture. The *rennaissance* and the *age of enlightenment* as they were called were the building blocks of the future culture of humanity ascendant. 

<!-- the technological revolutions of ancient earth marked the fragmenting of long held prinicples -->
As revolutions in technology brought prosperity, so did revolutions in thought bring disharmony. The long held place of the human being within the *zeitgeist* of ancient society was scrutinised for the comfortable fiction that it was. The sacred nature of man in the image of god, the divine right of kings, the separation of man from the nature that fed him; these were long held beliefs that would not survive the revolutions of thought and technology. These notions - mulched by the guilloitines of the age of revolutions - formed the fertile soil for the future of society. 

<!-- as these fragments were scrutinised, ideology and philosophy began to drive the unification of societies -->

## The Market Society - The First Empire

The focus of the *market society* is to allow for the accumulation of wealth amongst its participants. This society values private property and private enterprise and fiercly defends the interests of those that it sees as producing market value. With its focus on the rights of private property the market society is ostensibly one of individual liberties. 

### The Market and the Individual 

The individual's right to access the market is enshrined in the constitution of the Empire. All citizens are free to purchase commodities and services, and to sell commodities and services.

## The Marshal Society - The Second Empire

The Marshal society seeks to order its citizens towards a singular purpose through education, indoctrination, coercion, and force. This top down approach demands obedience from its citizens toward a central (or centralised) authority. 

***

## The Holy Society - The Third Empire

The Holy society (or sometimes called the theocratic society) seeks to garner worship of some mythic history; whether this history be God, the ruling dynasty, or the birth of the society itself.

## The Synthetic Society - The Fourth Empire

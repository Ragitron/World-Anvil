# Theories of Human Progress

## Confluence Hypothesis

> Society ebs and flows in its progress, spurred forward or regressed by technology, calamity, or memetic theory. Often shifts in society focus on individuals of greatness that have been able to take advantage or are uniquely suited to capitalising on the trends of the time. 

Proposed in opposition to the [Great Person Hypothesis](#great-person-hypothesis) and [Human Garden Hypothesis](./human-garden-hypothesis.md, Confluence Theory quickly spread through academic and political thought. Eventually becoming the core principles underlying psychohistorical analysis in the [Second Empire](../Organisation/second-empire.md). 

The hypothesis suggests that the famous and infamous of history that appear to singularly direct the course of history are merely tools or focal points of the shifts in society of their time. Transported to other times, and other society pivots these people would fade into the mass of humanity with the rest of their peer; whatever gifts and ambitions they may have possessed being useless in the wrong context. 

An alternative description of the hypothesis is that society makes people that appear to alter history. Suggesting that although such individuals were uniquely suited to alter history, the march of society dictated that *some* individual would alter history with no prescription for which one. Whether society merely expends great individuals on its own march, or beseeches great individuals to direct it is controversial.

## Human Garden Hypothesis

> "These automatons merely run the machinery of empire, their consciousness would be questionable if not for their endless complaints. How such masses of human misery breed greatness is beyond me"
		> - *Ashford* (Planter of Flags)

The *Human Garden* is the notion that the endless generations of humanity turn ceaselessly until individuals are born that will inevitably impel a society to to change. In opposition to the [Confluence Hypothesis](#confluence-hypothesis), the Garden hypothesis observes that societies over a long enough timeline will continue to perpetuate old traditions, only chnaging when challenged by a great individual.

In the Garden, society is a passive process with its inhabitants only purpose being the continuation of the society in which they reside. Eventually a great individual will advance that society toward great complexity of thought and culture.; or more accurately to change. Although such progress is often mired by periods of stagnation, calamity, or conflict with other societies. 

Within this theory are two competing interpretations. The widely held is the *Catalyst* or *Wallerian* interpretation that presents great individuals as catalysts as in chemistry. These individuals accentuate existing processes in society, the exaggeration forcing change due to disruption.  

The competing *Heretic* or *Hegelian* interpretation presents great individuals in conflict with the existing world. The interpretation posits that greatness inherently leads to conflict with wider society, and the greater the individual the more they pull society to their view. This suggests that the greatest individuals have existed in the widest societies that have required the most significant change. However in the modern era this has lead to slower change as "greater" individuals - and hence rarer - are required to pull these wider more modern societies to change.

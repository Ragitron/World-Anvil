# Merkel Effect

<!---
I had something here that was really good but forget it

The *Merkel Effect* refers to the observation that given sufficient energy a mass can be accelerated to a few magnitudes shy of *c*; and then be translated at a velocity seemingly beyond *c*. This results in a release of energy at the destination that is proportional to the mass and the translation velocity. 

$$E_{ejection} \propto mv_{translation}$$

Although apparently closely related to Einstein's famous equation the *merkel transformation* in full relies on a number of archaic constants that have not been experimentally verified.

The theory of n-Space was developed after the discovery of the Merkel Effect and describes the non-physical space outside of physical reality. Although the theory has gone through countless iterations over many millennia human understanding of n-space remains limited and largely practical. Numerous predictions about the nature of n-space have been contradicted by experimentation, and although FTL travel through n-space remains reliable and continues to be improved advances are generally incremental and accidental with limited advanced from focused research.

Although originally thought to be the dimensionless void between physical planes experimentation has shown that n-space both has spacial dimensions, yet appears to provide a pivot for between vast expanses of real-space.

# *n*-Space

The theory of *n*-Space was developed after the discovery of the [[merkel-effect]] and describes the non-physical space outside of physical reality. Although the theory has gone through countless iterations over many millennia human understanding of *n*-space remains limited and largely practical. Numerous predictions about the nature of n-space have been contradicted by experimentation, and although FTL travel through n-space remains reliable and continues to be improved advances are generally incremental and accidental with limited advanced from focused research.

Although originally thought to be the dimensionless void between physical planes experimentation has shown that *n*-space both has spacial dimensions and time dimensions, yet appears to provide a pivot for between vast expanses of real-space.

## The Upsilon Experiments

The *Upsilon Experiments* are a series of observations that have been collated at the time of the [Fourth Empire](fourth-empire.md) which have been used as partial explanations for the nature of *n*-space. Briefly these experiments have demonstrated that *n*-space:
1. is not subject to the classical laws of Information Theory in a traditional manner
	1. whilst allowing the passage of information through it, *n*-space will not permit information to leave that breaches the [Information Paradox](information-paradox.md)
2. interacts with some subatomic particles, but that this is interaction is unpredictable
3. does not bind the speed of light
4.

With the commercial viability of n-space drives came the rise of the First Empire. No longer shackled to relativistic travel, the fleets of Greater Terra could out-maneuver any colonial challenger by weeks providing a decisive advantage. 

Although the cataclysmic energy release at the point of translation has prevented the use of *n*-space drives within stellar terminus limits. No other means of travel has demonstrated reliability and efficiency on the same scale (although rumours of *n*-space "warps" or "jumps" abound this has only been demonstrated within-system in the literature, and only ever with quantum scale masses).

With continuing advancement in technology - if not understanding - of *n*-space, by the time of the collapse of the Second Empire travel times were 60 - 70% that of light. While the bleeding edge ships of the Stellarii could manage 40% to some systems. Curiously, ansible stations at the outer edges of more developed systems seeming to limit the speed of travel. This resulted in travel times of 90% of light time at best when travelling to and from Greater Terra.

By the rise of the Third Empire and the Reclamation, n-space efficiency had seemingly plateaued to 40% of light time. Obsessed with finding the edges of space known to their forefathers, the Third Empire funded all manner of research into n-space. This lead to the rediscovery of the Information paradox where ships arriving before their ostensible departure time would find no observable evidence of their departure. Catalogues of flotilla travel also found millions of lost or delayed ships that could not be accounted for.

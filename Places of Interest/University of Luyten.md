# Universit of Luyten

The orbiting habitats of [[Luyten's Star]] during the era of the [[Imperium]] would be rebuilt and repurposed for the reformation of the [[Stellarii]]. The largest of these habitats would be utilised wargames and training of ground teams, while at the edge of the system the *University of Luyten* would be established. The campus would fill the entire habitat cylinder medieval and modernistic style buildings trying to emulate the universities of ancient Earth.   

While initially established as military academy, the scientific education of military researchers resulted in a concentration of minds. The establishment of laboratories meant the Unversity would become a nexus for scientific advancement. Although the [[Imperium]] would never see civilians within the walls of the Universtiy, the liberalisation that lead to the [[Fourth Empire]] turned over the University to the colonial population of [[Luyten's Star]] and the capital planet of [[Ulaanbataar]].

# University of Luyten

The orbiting habitats of [[luytens-star]] during the era of the [[third-empire|Imperium]] would be rebuilt and repurposed for the reformation of the [[Stellarii]]. The largest of these habitats would be utilised wargames and training of ground teams, while at the edge of the system the *University of Luyten* would be established. The campus would fill the entire habitat cylinder medieval and modernistic style buildings trying to emulate the universities of ancient Earth.   

While initially established as a military academy, the scientific education of military researchers resulted in a concentration of minds. The establishment of laboratories meant the Unversity would become a nexus for scientific advancement. Although the [[third-empire|Imperium]] would never see civilians within the walls of the Universtiy, the liberalisation that lead to the [[Fourth Empire]] turned over the University to the colonial population of [[luytens-star]] and the capital planet of [[Ulaanbataar]].

# University of Luyten

The orbiting habitats of [Luyten's Star](../Systems/luytens-star.md) during the era of the [Imperium](../Organisation/third-empire.md) would be rebuilt and repurposed for the reformation of the [Stellarii](../Organisation/Stellarii/stellarii.md). The largest of these habitats would be utilised wargames and training of ground teams, while at the edge of the system the _University of Luyten_ would be established. The campus would fill the entire habitat cylinder medieval and modernistic style buildings trying to emulate the universities of ancient Earth.   

While initially established as a military academy, the scientific education of military researchers resulted in a concentration of minds. The establishment of laboratories meant the Unversity would become a nexus for scientific advancement. Although the [Imperium](../Organisation/third-empire.md) would never see civilians within the walls of the Universtiy, the liberalisation that lead to the [Fourth Empire](../Organisation/fourth-empire.md) turned over the University to the colonial population of [Luyten's Star](luytens-star.md) and the capital planet of [Ulaanbataar](../Systems/luytens-star.md#Ulaanbataar).

# The Federation 

The youngest of the human empires was formed in response to the aggressive expansion of [[Ancient-Earth|The Empire]]. Uniting against the [[Second Subjugation Fleet]], the Federation fought the conquerors to a stand still and brokered a ceasefire with a demilitarised wasteland betwen them. 

The Federation claims the worlds [[Spartan Landing]], [[Musashi]], and [[Napoleon]] as their core. The political capital being [[The Citadel]] in orbit around the uninhabitated binary [[Alpha Caesar|Alpha Caesar and Caesar Secundus]] 

## Foundation Story 

The idea of Federation had already been thrown about amongst the most prosperous colonies that would eventually form its cultural, economic, and political centres. These colonies were located on worlds within 10 ly of each other. Even throughout the [[Contraction|Founding]] these colonies maintained some loose communication channels. The [[First Age]] began to see physical trade amongst these worlds as well as more distance planets. Despite political entanglement between all of these world, no uniting cause or identity could be formed. Even during the [[First Age]] these planets engaged in skirmishes for control of strategic systems and gravity lanes. 

The Federation's first knowledge of [[Ancient-Earth|The Empire]] was a refugee crisis at the world [[Harlan's Reach]] where a fleet of industrial ships carrying several million refugees engaged a much smaller orbital skirmish force believing they had stumbled into [[Ancient-Earth|The Empire's]] logistic worlds. The [[Seige of Harlan's Reach]] lead to the death of millions of refugees and the loss of the colonial centre on the surface of [[Harlan's Reach]]. 

Despite the forwarning, the disunity of the Federated worlds lead to many factions questioning the veracity of the refugee claims. This hesitation granted [[Ancient-Earth|The Empire]] swathes of territorial gains. The first resistance being mustered at [[Fidel Serpentis]] by the [[Spartan Landing#Military|Spartan Expeditionary Fleet]]. Although the defending forces were lost, this bloodied the invaders and allowed the *Federation* to reorganise their forces and prepare their defensive lines. The [[Second Subjugation Fleet]] would be halted at the strategic world of [[Saladin's Horizon#Siege of Saladin's Horizon|Saladin's Horizon]], and the fortications around the planet [[Richard's Throne#Battle of Richard's Throne|Richard's Throne]]. 

## Philosophical Foundations 

The Federation was defined by disunity during its birth, however the pressure cooker of a war with [[Ancient-Earth|The Empire]] forged an obsession with the Generals and Admirals, in particular [[Martyrdom of General Shen|General Shen]] who commanded the ground forces of the [[Spartan Landing#Military|Spartan Expeditionary Fleet]]. This cultural obsession would be expressed in [[The Great Commander]] - a philosophical work that was partly narrative history - that exulted singular leaders as the drivers of human progress.

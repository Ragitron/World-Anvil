# Descendants 

The *Descendants* claim to inhabit the original home planet of the human species and have the the largest census of human inhabits across the planets they command. 

## Foundation Story 

The Empire of the Descendants - or merely *The Empire* - emerged from the [[Contraction|ruins of the first men]]. The [[First Colonial Fleet]] emerged from the home system of *The Empire* during the [[First Age]] and established numerous outposts in the star systems within 100 ly of the home system. Amongst these outposts were the planets [[Thoth]], [[Montu]], and [[Sekhmet]]^[[[Wikipedia-articles#^egyptdiety|Egyptian Gods and Goddesses]] of scripture, war, and protection or destruction, respectively]; as well as some one hundred orbital habitats and fortifications. This expansion would form the core of *The Empire* - and until the [[Razing of Heneb]] would never host a hostile faction or fleet within its reach.  

After the first colonial wave *The Empire* began to brush against the smaller empires that were emerging in the [[Second Age]]. This period saw the formation of the [[Second Subjugation Fleet]] and the assimilation of numerous colonies into *The Empire*. This aggressive expansion triggered a response from the peripheral colonies that federated and successfully resisted assimilation in the *The Empire*. Despire having its conquest stalled and the [[Second Subjugation Fleet|fleet]] nearly destroyed, *The Empire* would still manage to consolidated vast swathes of galactic territory, adding hundreds more planets to its control and tens of thousands of habitats. 

## Philosophical Foundations

If there is a central philosophy that has persevered through *The Empire's* history it is the belief that humanity can only prosper through expansion. Although the factions that would spar for power on [[Old-Earth|Earth]] would interpret this differently this centrel tenet would result in almost ceaseless conquest at the periphery of *The Empire's* domain.

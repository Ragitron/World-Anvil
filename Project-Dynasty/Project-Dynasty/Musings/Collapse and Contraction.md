While the fiction throughout these folders may reference a great collapse, scouring, or suffering; the truth should be that humanity has only ever expanded its reach and prosperity. Some areas have indeed sufferred at the hands of fate or more commonly other factions, but there has not occurred some grand collapse of a mighty empire that stood astride the arms fo the galaxy. 

While historical accounts would reference such an event, no *objective* finding should be presented to corroborate this. There should be no ancient ruins that are older than the empires, there should be no lost technology. The *Grand History of Humanity* is a myth perpetuated by the self serving factions within the empires.

The actual history is that humanity merely expanded beyond the reach of history. The expanse of the galaxy swallowed the colonies before they could be documented. There was never a grand empire, merely the colonies and the factions on them that deluded themselves that they were enacting their manifest destiny. 

The emergence of the empires is not the rise of humanity following collapse, but the unification of humanity through its own ingenuity. *The Empire* emerged when pangalactic infrastructure could be first established using the ansible. 

Similar technologies would rise up at similar times from related groups of scientists that importantly were working with the same foundational knowledge as the *The Empire*. The only reason for *The Empire* being first on the scene is that it began with larger population.

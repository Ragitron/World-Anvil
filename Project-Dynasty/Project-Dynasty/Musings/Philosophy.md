The great empires of the *Third Age* are distinguished by singular philosophies to the prosperity of humanity within their borders. However, rather than being monolithic constructs, these empires are composed of factions, each with their own interpretation of the core philosophy. 

In *The Empire*, the drive expansion is fundamental to how the empire views itself. However, throughout the history of the empire this has been achieved through diplomacy and conquest. The warhawks would reason that for the empire to continue to expand the galactic rivals must be subjugated or crushed, the builders believe that the future of the empire lies internal expansion and work to turn the core systems into gargantuan megastructures, while the exlorers work at the bleeding of edges of science to expand the empire out of its reality to conquer other dimensions. 

Similarly the *Federation* venerates individuals, the fascists believe that great individuals are forged by a strong, marshal society, while the eugenicists believe that becoming a great person is every individuals right and fund research into genetic and cybernetic manipulation. The most extreme of these factions believe that only the *Federation* is capable of producing great individuals and hence the *Federation* must conquer *The Empire*.

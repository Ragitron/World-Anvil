# The Rampant 

Once known as the *Nerok Maro* - also known as the Invader Empire - the Rampant had once ravaged the [[Second Empire]], demolishing it to its very foundations and leaving worlds infested by their breeding colonies. 

## First Contact 

The [[Second Empire]] had already [[Second Empire#Collapse|been in decline]] for centuries when the Rampant emerged out from the [[Galactic Features and Local Quadrants|Perseus Arm]]. 

The first colony to make contact was [[Khe San]] - an independent colony falling under the [[Second Empire#Treaty Planets|Treaty of Commercial Independence]]. Rightly wary the denizens of [[Khe San]] initially attempted cordon off their core habitat swarms from the Invader probes. However the loss of an outlying mining skiff along with its seventy-odd families impelled the colony to attack the observation ships in orbit at the system terminus. 

The final communication recorded from the colony being a battle report citing the loss of several dozen torch freighters retrofit with weapons, and the fatal mauling of a survey ship play-acting as a swarm carrier. The heavy losses buying the Colony the death of a single Invader Observer. The advance of the Rampant would come quickly following, outlying worlds quickly lost. Smaller colonies were simply swallowed behind the advancing front.

## The Battle of [[Kurkut|Penance]]

Finally woken from its slumber [[Greater Terra]] finally mobilised its home fleet to meet the invasion. Additional fleets were drawn from the scattering of principalities, some against the will of the people.

# The Rampant

Once known as the *Nerok Maro* - also known as the Invader Empire - the Rampant had once ravaged the [Second Empire](../Organisation/second-empire.md), demolishing it to its very foundations and leaving worlds infested by their breeding colonies. 

## First Contact

The [Second Empire](second-empire.md) had already [been in decline](second-empire.md#Collapse) for centuries when the Rampant emerged out from the [Perseus Arm](galactic-features-and-local-quadrants.md#Perseus%20Arm).

The first colony to make contact was [Khe San](khe-san.md) - an independent colony falling under the [Treaty of Commercial Independence](second-empire.md#Treaty%20Planets) Rightly wary the denizens of [Khe San](khe-san.md) initially attempted cordon off their core habitat s.warms from the Invader probes. However the loss of an outlying mining skiff along with its seventy-odd families impelled the colony to attack the observation ships in orbit at the system terminus. 

The final communication recorded from the colony being a battle report citing the loss of several dozen torch freighters retrofit with weapons, and the fatal mauling of a survey ship play-acting as a swarm carrier. The heavy losses buying the Colony the death of a single Invader Observer. The advance of the Rampant would come quickly following, outlying worlds quickly lost. Smaller colonies were simply swallowed behind the advancing front.

## The Battle of [Penance](kurkut.md#Penance)

Finally woken from its slumber [Greater Terra](greater-terra.md) finally mobilised its [home fleet](terran-home-fleet.md) to meet the invasion. Additional fleets were drawn from the scattering of principalities, some against the will of the people.

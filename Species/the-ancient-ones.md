# The Ancient Ones

The Ancient Ones are a blatant ripoff of both the 40K necrons and everything by Lovecraft.

The Ancients have existed before this universe and will exist after the next. They are a truly timeless consciousness confined to innumerable Leviathan ships that have fallen through the fabric of the cosmos into the void. Unable to navigate the dimensional non-space they remain dormant, turning their malevolent minds toward the problem of conquering the void.

In the darkness of the Void the Ancient leviathan ships are lost to time, they emerge sporadically into this universe by luck or misfortune to claim planets and seed them with subterranean manufactories. The facilities expand throughout the planet, consuming all raw materials and burning out the core until only a vast warehouse of war-drones remains. Eventually the drones wake and begin to build void arrays throughout the local system.

# Greater Terra

*Greater Terra* refers to the inhabitated planets and satellites of the Sol system and is traditionally thought of as the birth place of humanity. Typically divided into [[Greater Terra#Core Worlds|Inner or Core worlds]], [[Greater Terra#Periphery]], and [[Greater Terra#Oort Belt]]; *Greater Terra* has as many as two thousand inhabitated celestial bodies. This gives *Greater Terra* a population that at times through its history, had been greater than the rest of its Empire combined.

## Core Worlds

The Core worlds represent the industrial and cultural centre of *Greater Terra* and encompasses all worlds within the demarcation of the extant Asteroid belt, as well as several strategically important Jovian moons. 

### Earth

Earth is the origin of the human species and has remained the seat of power of all Human Empires. Despite ecological disaster - some wrought by humanity - Earth remains the source of biodiversity throughout the Empire. A wellspring of naturally occurring mutations and species Earth hosts numerous biological research laboratories. The most prestigious - and the only one maintaining a terrestrial presence throughout Earth's history - is the [[Hook Foundation]], with other organisations relegated to orbital facilities.

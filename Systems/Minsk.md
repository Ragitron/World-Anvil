Minsk remained a struggling colony long after humanity had conquered most of the rest of the galaxy.
Orbiting a K-Type Bright Giant with perfuse radiation throughout the star system made the prospect of regular trade unplatable to numerous companies.
The Population of Minsk remained small as a matter of survival, given the limited availability of acrage for agriculture, even when housed in hermitic hydroponics towers.

Minsk briefly became a centre of power production when the <link:internal>Bellspeare Dynasty</link:internal> installed a Dyson Cloud of solar arrays to power their fleet.
However the fall of the dynasty also meant these arrays were no longer maintained, and Minsk lacked the resources to rebuild the cloud themselves.

Minsk remained lost to cultural knowledge throughout the rise and fall of the [[Jacobian Kingdom]], and was eventually "rediscovered" during the [[Inter Expansion Years#Local Expansions (Enlightenment Era)|Enlightenment Era]].
[[Inter Expansion Years#Local Expansions (Enlightenment Era)|Enlightenment Era]] technology allowed rapid terraforming and geo-engineering of Minsk reshaping it into something far removed from its original form.

Eventually Minsk would be rediscovered for a third time toward the end of its host stars life.
The Planet was then found as a sprawling architecture with the ancient surface of canyons and mesas buried beneath the depths of the city.
Pan-stellar constructs linked the planet directly to a decaying dyson sphere that had all but collapsed the star, with its failing gravity tethers preventing obliteration of the star system in a nova.

# Tobruk

> **Alpha Serpentis** binary star system

## Colonisation

*Tobruk* was founded in the [[Third Expansion]] during the last centuries of the [[First Empire]] bankrolled by a forgotten non-profit organisation, the motivations of which remain unclear. For the settler's of the [[Generation Ship]] *Novangelia* the system was an escape from the collapsing economies of the [[First Empire]]'s core world's. The *Novangelia* arrived originally in a parking orbit around the satellite of the planet that would eventually become the systems namesake. The satellite was similarly disproportionately sized to [[*Earth*]]'s own satellite and it was assumed at the time this provided the planet with a degree of environmental stability.

The satellite's weak gravity allowed the colonists to begin construction of a way station, although construction efforts languished in the early centuries of the colony becoming little more than an automated refuelling depot for mining operations in system. This suggested that there was disagreement amongst the polity of the *Novangelia* in regards to their continuing relationship with the [[First Empire]]. It would appear that some still maintained some loyalty to the Empire in the early centuries, this loyalty would not survive to the next generation of colonists.

The planet that would become *Tobruk* was smaller than [[*Earth*]] although maintained a similar gravity thanks to unusually large reservoirs of heavy metals within the planets lithosphere and core. The Colonists encountered a cloyingly thick atmosphere with high proportions of simple hydrocarbons, bereft of oxygen, and at almost all latitudes filled with mycotic spores that fed directly from the hydrocarbons. With limited resources to retreat from the planet's surface the colonists established themselves regardless. Their modular habitats would quickly become replaced with hardened sandstone structures that would eventually come to define *Tobruk* architecture. The planetary capital would become the mountain city of **Valderra** located at the original colony dropsite.  

*Novangelia's* parking orbit is considered an unusual decision for single journey [[Generation Ship]]s (ordinarily these would be cannabilised planetside to establish their colony). It appeared that the colonists aboard were divided as the ideal location for their colony. A satellite of the gas giant *Serpentis-342* appeared to provide a more enticing location with the appearance of frozen canals and ice caps across its surface. The planet of *Alamein* was colonised in parallel to *Tobruk*, the division of colonists resulting in short-lived tensions between the colonial population. These tensions would die with the first generation of colonists with no military conflict. *Alamein* was in absolute terms larger than *Tobruk* however less dense, with a thinner atmosphere and no local ecosystem. Its frozen canals and ice sheets had entombed large reservoirs of methane that provided a cheap local energy industry, preserving as yet limited fusion fuels.

The two colonies maintained the original government aboard the *Novangelia* throughout at least the first century. A catastrophic solar storm from the *Serpentis* binary disabled the *Novangelia* sometime in the second century of colonisation resulting in the isolation of the sister colonies. Although long range communications would quickly be re-established, *Serpentis* would continue its solar seizure for several centuries retarding the stellar development of the colonies. It would not however halt progress on the local development of the individual colonies.

## Development

### Agriculture

The first century of *Tobruk's* development saw rapid expansion of its infrastructure utilising the still well maintained manufacturing facilities of the *Novangelia*. Printed and modular architecture became the foundations for both the colonies of *Tobruk Proper* and *Alamein*. *Novangelia's* archicultural decks were expanded to support the populations of both planets, this stretched the industry of the aging [[Generation Ship]] to the breaking point. The colonies would have to quickly develop local agriculture in order expand.

The cave systems of the *Tobruk* mountain ranges were expanded into hermetic chambers, mycotic invasion was ruthlessly exterminated creating underground greenhouses. The atmospheric hydrocarbons would be used to fuel the greenhouses of fungal cultivars and these would become the staple diet of the *Tobruk* colonists.

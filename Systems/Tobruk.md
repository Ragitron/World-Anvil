## Planets 

### Tobruk  

The capital of the system is ont he planet of the same name. The mycotic world within the the inner sphere of the binary stars *Serpentis* was first discovered from spectral data during the [[Pre-Expansion Era]] and surveyed at the end of the [[First Expansion]]. However no colonisation efforst would be attempted until the [[Third Expansion]] when the *Novanegelia* was crowd-funded by despondent settlers from across the vestiges of the [[First Empire]]. The majority of the population hailed from [[Paris]] and [[Bangladesh]] bringing with them the still thriving [[Hindu Philosophy]] and the novel of ideas of [[Diasporad Thought]].  

Although temporality is difficult to establish across the lifetime of the human empires, most evidence suggests that the *Novangelia* arrived in system around the time of the [[Battle of Mars]]. 


## Colonisation



The satellite's weak gravity allowed the colonists to begin construction of a way station, although construction efforts languished in the early centuries of the colony becoming little more than an automated refuelling depot for mining operations in system. This suggested that there was disagreement amongst the polity of the *Novangelia* in regards to their continuing relationship with the [[First Empire]]. It would appear that some still maintained some loyalty to the Empire in the early centuries, this loyalty would not survive to the next generation of colonists.

The planet that would become *Tobruk* was smaller than *[[Earth]]* although maintained a similar gravity thanks to unusually large reservoirs of heavy metals within the planets lithosphere and core. The Colonists encountered a cloyingly thick atmosphere with high proportions of simple hydrocarbons, bereft of oxygen, and at almost all latitudes filled with mycotic spores that fed directly from the hydrocarbons. With limited resources to retreat from the planet's surface the colonists established themselves regardless. Their modular habitats would quickly become replaced with hardened sandstone structures that would eventually come to define *Tobruk* architecture. The planetary capital would become the mountain city of **Valderra** located at the original colony dropsite.  

*Novangelia's* parking orbit is considered an unusual decision for single journey [[Generation Ship]]s (ordinarily these would be cannabilised planetside to establish their colony). It appeared that the colonists aboard were divided as to the ideal location for their colony. A satellite of the gas giant *Serpentis-342* appeared to provide a more enticing location with the appearance of frozen canals and ice caps across its surface. The planet of *Alamein* was colonised in parallel to *Tobruk*, the division of colonists resulting in short-lived tensions between the colonial population. These tensions would die with the first generation of colonists with no military conflict. *Alamein* was in absolute terms larger than *Tobruk* however less dense, with a thinner atmosphere and no local ecosystem. Its frozen canals and ice sheets had entombed large reservoirs of methane that provided a cheap local energy industry, preserving as yet limited fusion fuels.

The two colonies maintained the original government aboard the *Novangelia* throughout at least the first century. A catastrophic solar storm from the *Serpentis* binary disabled the *Novangelia* sometime in the second century of colonisation resulting in the isolation of the sister colonies. Although long range communications would quickly be re-established, *Serpentis* would continue its solar seizure for several centuries retarding the stellar development of the colonies. It would not however halt progress on the local development of the individual colonies.

## Development

### Tobruk



### Agriculture

The first century of *Tobruk's* development saw rapid expansion of its infrastructure utilising the still well maintained manufacturing facilities of the *Novangelia*. Printed and modular architecture became the foundations for both the colonies of *Tobruk Proper* and *Alamein*. *Novangelia's* archicultural decks were expanded to support the populations of both planets, this stretched the industry of the aging [[Generation Ship]] to the breaking point. The colonies would have to quickly develop local agriculture in order expand.

The cave systems of the *Tobruk* mountain ranges were expanded into hermetic chambers, mycotic invasion was ruthlessly exterminated creating underground greenhouses. The atmospheric hydrocarbons would be used to fuel the greenhouses of fungal cultivars and these would become the staple diet of the *Tobruk* colonists. These fungal cultivars would remain vulnerable to mycotic invasion for the next millenium, resulting in a culture of rationing and strict resource preservation. After the "lost millenium" of the *Serpentis* solar turmoil, *Tobruk's* agricultural industry had turned toward gargantuan vertical farms and deep fungal greenhouses.

On the planet *Alamein* agriculture took the form of bioreactors and algal protein eking out an existence in the distant sunlight. These bioreactors were located on the edges of the ice caps became the centre of small settlements. The lack of sunlight around the equatorial canals meant bioreactors in these regions would be highly inefficient. Such bioreactors would remain a dominant feature of *Alamein* cities throughout the "Lost Millenium", until the development of local stellar infrastructure would allow the sister colonies to pool their resources into orbital farming.

### Terraforming  

*Alamein* would remain un-terraformed until its recycling in the [[Third Empire]]. Originally devoid of life over several millenia the bioreactor effluent and sewage reservoirs would result in a limited microbial biosphere. Debate continues as to whether this biosphere formed *de novo* from terran organic material or was in fact contaminant bacteria from the colony. Once recycled into the [[Shell World]] of *Holy Alamein* the planet became a thriving population centre but maintained a chilly atmosphere in reverence to its origins.

The hostile atmosphere of *Tobruk* was eventually tamed after several millenia of geo-engineering. The first effort to terraform *Tobruk* began in the second century of colonisation with the construction of the first atmospheric cyclers. These gargantuan machines vacuumed the local atmosphere of the colony wiping out whole species of mycotic spores in the first few years of their activation. After the the collapse of the government aboard the *Novangelia*, the local consulate of the colony in the *Valtus Canyon* (what would eventually become **Valderra**) initiated a infrastructural doctrine that would be upheld through to eventual reunification with *Alamein*.

The **Hermann Doctrine** (named after a famous engineer who had passed away aboard the *Novangelia* in transit to *Tobruk*) in specifics is lost to time, however it was clear that it outlined several goals for the development of the colony. The primary goal of these projects was to make *Tobruk* habitable for human life. The local ecosystem of mycotic spores was deemed too hostile to be in any way compatible or exploitable, and far too primitive to warrant any consideration of ecologic preservation (an result of the old *[[Environmental Complexity]]* that governed much of the terraforming efforts of the [[Second Empire]]).

By the time of the second millenium of colonisation, the local mycotic spores were forced into minute ecologic niches, going with them the hydrocarbon content of the atmosphere - an outcome that many had anticipated.

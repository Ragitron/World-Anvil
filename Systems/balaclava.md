Although Balaclava formed the heart of the [Bellspeare Dynasty] and its cultural centre, it had remained relatively depopulated in comparison to the other planets of the dynasty.
Following the fall of the [Bellspeare Dynasty], *Balaclava* was rendered almost unihabitable by orbital bombardment.
However significant archealogical interest in the planet initiated geo-engineering efforts to clear the atmosphere and restore the planet to a pre-colonial state.

This has revitalised the planet and in less than a century *Balaclava* is once more a cultural and academic centre within its sector.**

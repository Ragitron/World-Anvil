# Greater Terra

*Greater Terra* refers to the inhabitated planets and satellites of the Sol system and is traditionally thought of as the birth place of humanity. Typically divided into [Inner or Core worlds](#Core%20Worlds), [Periphery](#Periphery), and [Oort Belt](#Oort%20Belt); *Greater Terra* has as many as two thousand inhabitated celestial bodies. This gives *Greater Terra* a population that at times through its history, had been greater than the rest of its Empire combined.

## Core Worlds

The Core worlds represent the industrial and cultural centre of *Greater Terra* and encompasses all worlds within the demarcation of the extant Asteroid belt, as well as several strategically important Jovian moons. 

### Earth

Earth is the origin of the human species and has remained the seat of power of all Human Empires. Despite ecological disaster - some wrought by humanity - Earth remains the source of biodiversity throughout the Empire. A wellspring of naturally occurring mutations and species Earth hosts numerous biological research laboratories. The most prestigious - and the only one maintaining a terrestrial presence throughout Earth's history - is the [Hook Foundation](../Organisation/Corporations/hook-foundation.md), with other organisations relegated to orbital facilities. 

The History of Earth is the history of humanity, until at least the [Second Expansion](../Empire%20in%20Snapshots/The%20Expansions/second-expansion.md) when the [First Empire](../Organisation/first-empire.md) is considered to have formed and Earth's importance became secondary to that of Greater Terra itself. By the millenia of the [Second Expansion](../Empire%20in%20Snapshots/The%20Expansions/second-expansion.md) much of Earth's industrial parks had been dismantled and moved into orbit or to other celestial bodies. Even the seat of political power had moved off the planet to the gargantuan orbital monolith called [Nebuchadnezzar Station](../Places%20of%20Interest/Megastructures/nebuchadnezzar-station.md). While cities continued to buzz with money and culture, the prosperity of Earth's population gently suppressed fertility rates. 

While the population of Earth dwarfed much of is own dominion, by the time the [First Empire](../Organisation/first-empire.md) was in its death throes, the population had withered to only several hundred million. Much of these denizens had confined themselves to only two major cities, [Heng-sha](#Heng-sha) and [Madrigal](#Madrigal); the rest of the planet being sparsely populated with families and hermits of groundskeepers, forest rangers, and wardens when necessary.

After the fall of the [First Empire](../Organisation/first-empire.md), Earth maintained a sparse population, maintaining its robust internal trade network within the solar system itself. [Nebuchadnezzar Station](../Places%20of%20Interest/Megastructures/nebuchadnezzar-station.md) would continue to be poplitical centre, maintaining security and keeping tensions between Earth and its industrial satellites under control. Although Earth would not see a major war on its surface until the rise of the [Second Empire](../Organisation/second-empire.md), the sense of instability during the inter-imperial period lead to the re-forging of a modest industrial base on the planets surface. While [Heng-sha](#Heng-sha) relegated this industry to subterranean bunkers. While at [Madrigal](#Madrigal), industry was forced off the land and on to platforms like ancient oil-rigs that with time formed a ring of industrial platforms.

During this period, the smaller communities deep with the parks of Biodiversity formed their own townships. While it is presumed that some tribes had turned to primitivism, no evidence persisted of these colonies. The rest that left traces of their communities formed trade networks between the two cities.

<!---
Greater Terra is not actually one planet but a network of colonised planets within the Solar System, including Earth itself.
Greater Terra has formed the heart of the great Human empires and remains the cultural and spiritual home of Humanity.

Greater Terra  is occassionally at the center of debate about the start of <link:internal>Human expansion</link:internal> and numerous historians have insisted that the founding of settlements throughout the solar system should be referred to as First Expansion.
Most the cosmohistorical establishment refers to this period as the Primal Expansion, or the Early Expansion.

The First of the solar planets to be colonised was Io - technically a moon of Jupiter - followed swiftly by competing colonies and mining operations on *Mars*, the *Moon*, and *Europa*.
Eventually a permament outpost was established on *Pluto* as a platform for extra-solar expansion.
This clustering of human habitats is referred to as *Greater Terra* although in most common parlance any reference to *Earth* equally refers to these accessory colonies.

Although human habitats are present on almost all the planets of the Solar System, the five accessory planets of Earth are permanently inhabitated.

Uniquely throughout human civilisation, the populations of Greater Terra identify exclusively as Terran, holding no particular allegience to their home planet.
This attitude is attributed largely to the highly developed transpart network throughout the solar system that includes both public, corporate, and private transport networks.
This fluidity of population is held as a model for all extra-solar colonies and is emulated on thousands of worlds and star systems.

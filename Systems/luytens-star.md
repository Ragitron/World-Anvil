# Luyten's Star

**Luyten's Star** was colonised during the [Second Expansion](../Empire%20in%20Snapshots/The%20Expansions/second-expansion.md) and formerly "settled" after the fall of the [Second Empire](../Organisation/second-empire.md). Its population would be spared much of the direct conflict with the [Invader Empire](../Species/rampant.md) and become a focus of education for the [Imperium](../Organisation/third-empire.md).

# Luyten's Star

**Luyten's Star** was colonised during the [[second-expansion]] and formerly "settled" after the fall of the [[second-empire]]. Its population would be spared much of the direct conflict with the [[rampant|Invader Empire]] and become a focus of education for the [[third-empire|Imperium]].

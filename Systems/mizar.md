Tehran is known primarily as the home of the [Jacobian Kingdom](jacobian-kingdom.md) which succeeded [Second Empire](second-empire.md).
Tehran was luckily blessed with habitable atmosphere, stable climate, and was virgin to any organic life when humans first settled it.

Settled in the last centuries of the [First Empire](first-empire.md), *Tehran* was isolated for the first centuries of its life.
This bred a deep tradition of independence in the wealthy planet - this tradition is widely credited with catalysing its later prominance.
Benefiting greatly from the resource rich asteroid belt of it star system, the plant maintained many elements of its indepence throughout the [Third Empire](third-empire.md), and became home to one of the great shipyards of the period.

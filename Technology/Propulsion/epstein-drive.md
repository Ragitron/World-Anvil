# Epstein Drive

The *Epstein drive* as a term,applies to a number of varying designs of starship engine that utilise the [merkel effect](../../Physics/merkel-effect.md) to accelerate voidcraft between stellar systems. Although the original design of the *epstein drive* has no relationship to its successors the terminology has remained (much to the chagrin many [corporations](../../Organisation/organisation.md#corporations) attempting to instill their own terminology). Successor designs hardly resemble [Epstein's](#epstein) original design any part, except for their utilisation of the [merkel effect](../../Physics/merkel-effect.md). 


## Original Design

### Epstein

By the end of the [pre-expansion era](../../Empire%20in%20Snapshots/The%20Expansions/pre-expansion-era.md) the scientific output [Earth and its colonies](../../Systems/greater-terra.md) was unmatched compared to any time period in history. Vast belts of particle accelerators and physics laboratories drew in millions of scientific minds from across the colonies of the nascent empire. 

Amidst this highly competitive environment, Dr Epstein emerged as particularly ruthless in their efforts for scientific fame. Arguably of unparalleled brilliance, their development of the Epstein drive would cement their name in history. After the maiden flight of the [Hopeless Endeavour](../../Organisation/noteworthy-vessels.md#hopeless-endeavour)

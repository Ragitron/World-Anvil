# Bunker Vallum Epsilon

*Vallum Epsilon* was constructed in the [[Alpha Pegasi]] system in order to divert the tide of the [[Rampant]] invasion and allow a deeper defensive network to be constructed at [[Alpha Andromedae]]. Holding little strategic value the system had been abandoned by the collapsing [[Second Empire]] almost a millenium prior. At the time of the invasion it had been reclaimed by its natives the [[Alpha Pegasi#United Peoples|United Peoples]] that had numerous settlements in the vast ravines of [[Alpha Pegasi#Chinggis|Chinggis]]. 

Although initially left alone do its distance from the red dwarf at the system's centre, [[Alpha Pegasi#Chinggis|Chinggis]] itself was eventually consumed by the construction fleet to complete the bunker. The selected planet of *Alpha Pegasi Sucundus* was comparatively porous despite its size, and lacked much of the heavy metals and silicates needs to manufacture the blocks the Bunker would be constructed from.

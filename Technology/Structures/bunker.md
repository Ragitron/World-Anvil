At the time of the invasion it had been reclaimed by its natives the [United Peoples](../../Systems/alpha-pegasi.md#United%20Peoples) that had numerous settlements in the vast ravines of [Chinggis](../../Systems/alpha-pegasi.md#chinggis). 

Although initially left alone do its distance from the red dwarf at the system's centre, [Chinggis](../../Systems/alpha-pegasi.md#chinggis) itself was eventually consumed by the construction fleet to complete the bunker. The selected planet of *Alpha Pegasi Sucundus* was comparatively porous despite its size, and lacked much of the heavy metals and silicates needs to manufacture the blocks the Bunker would be constructed from.despite its size, and lacked much of the heavy metals and silicates needs to manufa

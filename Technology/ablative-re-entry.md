## Ablative Re-Entry  

...remains a commonly used technology well into the [Third Empire](../Organisation/third-empire.md), primarily on underdeveloped frontier worlds, as well as ecologically protected worlds where orbital infrastructure is heavily restricted if not entirely outlawed.

**Ablative Re-Entry** refers to the use of heat shields to allow landing craft to slow down by native atmospheres. These heat shields need to be rebuilt on re-usable craft periodically, or the entire craft may be single use.

Combat operations conducted by the the [Atmospherii](../Organisation/Stellarii/zephyrii.md) will employ ablative re-entry for much of is forward assault forces that generally precede a [conspicuous assault](../Concepts/conspicuous-assault.md).

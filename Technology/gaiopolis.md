Occassionally referred to as [[Garden Worlds]], the quintessential example is the panet of [[Mecca]] which had been colonised in the late stages of the [[First Empire]]. These planets upturn amost all of a planet's native geography and geology into one that has been pricesly engineered. On such a planet oceans and seas are used strategically as temperature reservoir, canals provide irrigation not just for agricultue but for semi-natural forests and confined environments.

> A planet that has been entirely geoengineered leaving no natural ecology, insteady bending all native and introduced flora and fauna toward maintaining a favourabe environment for human habitation.

Occassionally referred to as [Garden Worlds](./Structures/garden-worlds.md), the quintessential example is the panet of [Mecca](../Systems/mecca.md) which had been colonised in the late stages of the [First Empire](../Organisation/first-empire.md). These planets upturn amost all of a planet's native geography and geology into one that has been pricesly engineered. On such a planet oceans and seas are used strategically as temperature reservoir, canals provide irrigation not just for agricultue but for semi-natural forests and confined environments.

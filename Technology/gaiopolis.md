Occassionally referred to as [Garden Worlds](garden-worlds.md), the quintessential example is the panet of [Mecca](mecca.md) which had been colonised in the late stages of the [First Empire](first-empire.md). These planets upturn amost all of a planet's native geography and geology into one that has been pricesly engineered. On such a planet oceans and seas are used strategically as temperature reservoir, canals provide irrigation not just for agricultue but for semi-natural forests and confined environments.

# Network Anchors

At the heart of all Terran communication is the [network](./the-network.md) responsible for the collective intuition of entire planets and habitats. 

All networks form from an [Ansible](./superluminal-communication.md) station that bends gravity at a quantum level but require a level of computing power that had been unattainable for millenia as artificial intelligences could not achieve the level of processing required. This meant that early networks were used briefly by human operators for centralised communication by governmental organisations. 

AI hypernetworking would eventually allow for a pervasive [network](./the-network.md) from a single [Ansible](./superluminal-communication.md). However hypernetworks required massive installations of computing power and thermal infrastructure. This made [network](./the-network.md) communication impossible aboard starships outside of planetary orbit.

The computing power of the human brain had long been known to be capable of processing [network](./the-network.md) data into a pervasive web. Such human operators came to be known as *Anchors* providing local [network](./the-network.md) access to new colonies and settlements during the intervening years between the Empires. 

During the expansion of the [Second Empire](../../Organisation/second-empire.md), fleets capitalised on *Anchors* to generate local networks creating [Battlenets](./battlenet.md) for coordination. This unparalleled coordination allowed the smaller Imperial fleets to outmaneuver the vast [Remnant](../../Empire%20in%20Snapshots/remnant.md) fleets scattered across the homeworlds. Eventually the reliance on [Battlenets](./battlenet.md) lead to the adoption of life support cradles.

Life support cradles were contraversially implemented aboard the [Second Empire](../../Organisation/second-empire.md)'s 117th Fleet, where anchors were drawn from naval recruits that had suffered brainstem injury during training. This second generation of *Anchors* became archetypal. They were a permanent fixture of the fleet, required for all [network](./the-network.md) operations.

During the final expansion of the [Second Empire](../../Organisation/second-empire.md) - where it would be pitted against the rising Stellar Kingdoms of [Nerok Maro](../../Species/rampant.md) - the same technology that was used for *Anchors* would be implement in Fleet command structures. The first *Ship Captains* that were wired permanently into their ships were the oldest and experienced, leveraging their experience and the nibble hardware of their ships to make rapid decisions and communicate them instantaneously.

The war with the [Nerok Maro](../../Species/rampant.md) bled the [Second Empire](../../Organisation/second-empire.md)'s fleed and its *Ship Captains*. Volunteers were pressed into service to replace what came to be known as the [[Integrated Admiralty]]. Almost all ships with the exception of escorts and gunboats would become integrated with a *Ship Captain*. Utilising the collective decision-making capacity of the admiralty these fleet eventually won their war, subjugating the [Nerok Maro](../../Species/rampant.md). 

Shortly after the [Second Restoration](../../Organisation/second-empire.md#Second%20Restoration), *Anchors* came to be drawn from volunteers; while the selection of *Ship Captains* returned to a process favouring experience. 

Ship designers gradually moved to emplement integrated *Anchors* and *Ship Captains* into their blueprints. Many designs incorporated the aesthetics of a shrine around the Ansible and its *Anchors*, honoring the sacrifice of the volunteers.

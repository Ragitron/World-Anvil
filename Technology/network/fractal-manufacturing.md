# Fractal Manufacturing

Network chipsets had begun to proliferate in the middle period of the [Second Empire](../../Organisation/second-empire.md), when the [Network infrastructure](./the-network.md) had developed to a point that disparate worlds could freely communicate via the [Ansible](superluminal-communication.md).  

Such chipsets were specially crafted for intervidual users. The first generation being printed after mapping the wetware connections of the user's brain. This first generation was difficult for many operators to use, often requiring intensive training with the specific chip, making replacement difficult.

Fractal manufacturing was developed for the command systems of complex bio-organic and bio-mechanical robots. Fractal chipsets were in essence grown with use - in analogy to the growth of a human brain. Although third generation chips could be paired with middle aged users and grow in a handful of years, second generation chips were the dominant technology for over three millenia.

## Second Generation Fractal Chipsets  

These chipsets demonstrated their limitations early on, requiring years to develop even crude interfaces between the network and its users. Older user often experienced difficulty with the chip growth process, in particular a *simulacra phenomenon* occurred where operators attempted to coax their chipset into a certain functionality. This "unnatural" chipnet would then be built upon by the manufacturing process until the user endeavored a more complex task and the chipnet would misinterpret the users brain activity - in the best case scenario resulting in emergent resurfacing, although there exist at least two case reports of [Total Cognitive Fragmentation](./cognitive-fragmentation.md).

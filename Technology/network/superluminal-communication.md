# Superluminal Communication

Superluminal communication is the hypothetical process to transmit information faster than light, and hence is regarded as being impossible.

Potential Mechanisms:

- **Tachyons**: these are theoretical particles that are able to travel faster than light and back in time.
While they are real they do not have a superluminal *Signal Velocity* though do have a superluminal *Group Velocity*.
- **Quantum Non-Locality**: ie. Quantum entanglement has been shown not be able to transmit information faster than light
- **Wormholes** (aka. Einstein-Rosen Bridge): are theoretical cosmological entities that alow faster than light travel across vast stellar distances, and hence would be able to carry information in the same manner.

# In-World Superluminal Communication

Without reliable communication humanity would be unable to sustain a vast galactic empire beyond at most 10 light years in radius.
Superluminal communication was not robust until the First Empire, in truth being the primary catalyst for the unification of the scattered human colonies.
This early Subplanar Gateway was crude and only marginally increased communication speeds.

The development of the Planar Tunneling communication system during the [Enlightenment Era](enlightenment-era.md) has been the basis of all subsequent superluminal communication systems.

# Planar Tunneling

The Planar Tunnel is a physical concept attempting to describe the way the communication network folds spacetime in order to pass a beam of incoherent particles to a recieving station.
A decoding station is able to use the pattern of transmission and the relative density and composition of the particles to decipher a message.
While early networks barely managed to achieve more than a few bits per second, furthe development in particle beam accelerators and decodes increased speeds enough to allow direct voice communication between <link:internal>Celestially Adjacent Stars</link:internal>.

## Signal Loss

Experience with the Subplanar Gateway showed that any communication system based on aplanar signals would suffer significant information loss at a mathematically determined ratio.
While the theorotical basis for this loss has defied physical explanation for thousands of years the leading hypothesis is information is lost due to causality inteference.

This signal loss continued to hold true through the development and early use of the Planar Tunnel.
It was found that incoherent particles were the only way for superliminal messages to travel, that coherent particles and waveforms were utterly obliterated during passage.

Current signal technologies focus and fine-tuning the signal loss from the coherence (incoherence) of a particle beam, and its legibility at the target reciever.

## Line Of Sight

While planar tunnels have the enormous advantage of not being subject to gravitational distortion, relativity, or signal loss due to thermodynamics they do require direct line of site with a target reciever.
As such communication stations are obligated to maintain the most distant orbital path from their host star.

This means that over the course of the last several thousand years, a number of communication lines have been severed by the rotation of stellar bodies in the galaxy.
More immediately relevant however is the orbit of the communication stations themselves, which undergo significant yearl course correction to maintain vital lines.

## Energy Expenditure

Planar Tunneling is based on technology similar to the planar drive systems of modern starships.
Similarly transmission results in a local and distant burst of high energy particles and radiation.
This prohibits communication systems from orbiting within 20-25 AU of an inhabited planet.
In rare cases this requires communication stations to be situated outside the stellar terminus within the *Arrival Belt* for interstellar travel.
Such stations are so heavily armoured that most have been left unscathed by stellar warfare since their original construction.

Constant course correction requires significant fuel consumption and energy expenditure to maintain a communication network.
Hence, counter-intuitively, superluminal communication is faster than within system communication.
The human effect of this phenomenon is that most communication crews are entirely neutral and exempt from stellar conflict, .
Many have built habitation systems allowing for independence.

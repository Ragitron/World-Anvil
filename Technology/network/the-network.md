**The Network** has been foundational to the structure of human society since the [Second Empire](../../Organisation/second-empire.md). In simple terms it a mass communication structure of [ansibles](superluminal-communication.md) in combination with [limbic wetware](../implanted-communication.md) that allows the sharing of an emotional landscape across a population.
